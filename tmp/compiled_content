I just published a [blog post][1] on ARM's corporate blog with an overview of the recent [openSUSE ARM Hackathon][2]. We didn't quite manage all the tasks that we had hoped for, but we did get the big ones done.

 [2]: http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2013/03/14/geeko-pumping-iron-session-opensuse-arm-hackathon-08-12apr.html "Geeko Pumping Iron Session"

For me it was great to meet so many old friends, and some new ones. I'd like to say a few thanks to some of the people involved, they all did so much and this is just some of the things that they did:

* [openSUSE TSP][2] for helping Guillaume Gardet attend. 
* Guillaume, for his hardware doctor skills which were more than valuable and his dogged determination is a shining example. 
* Bernhard Wiedemann, for getting OpenStack working properly 
* Robert Schweikert, for getting down and dirty with the Chromebook
* Dirk M√ºller for integration of the new hardware into OBS and Cubiboard bring up
* Reinhard Max for deploying the new hardware in the data centre
* Lars Vogdt and team for maintanence & support of the hardware
* Luc Verhagen for being a bad influence and trying to get us all to party **every** night
* Egbert Eich for looking at the scary situation of ARM related Xorg stuff
* Marcus Sch√§fer for al the kiwi and Origen work
* Alex Graf for so much low level grunt work that without whom we wouldn't be in the current state
* SUSE for sponsoring both the location & accomodation and also for the occaisional breakfast and lunch

<p>Day 2 of EuroBSDCon (overview of <a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2013/09/27/eurobsdcon-devsummit-day-1.html" title="Overview of Day 1 of EuroBSDCon DevSummit">Day 1</a>)kicked off for me with the morning being dedicated to virtualization. In Linux we&#8217;re all used to the usual suspects - <span class="caps">KVM</span>/Xen/<span class="caps">LXC</span>/VMWare, so I was interested to hear what&#8217;s available on Free<span class="caps">BSD</span> especially <a href="http://blogs.arm.com/software-enablement/1079-transparent-superpages-for-freebsd-on-arm/" title="SuperPage support on FreeBSD by SemiHalf">bhyve</a> which is probably as close to <span class="caps">KVM</span> as one will&nbsp;get.</p>

<p>*Xen support is available in Free<span class="caps">BSD</span>, but only as DomU (guest <span class="caps">VM</span>). Dom0 (host server) support is actively being worked on though to rectify this shortfall (this does not apply to Net<span class="caps">BSD</span>). Xen <span class="caps">PVHVM</span> support is included in Free<span class="caps">BSD</span>&nbsp;10. 
*VMWare support is available for Free<span class="caps">BSD</span>&nbsp;guests. 
*Not overly surprising <span class="caps">LXC</span> is not supported but Free<span class="caps">BSD</span> does have&nbsp;Jails. 
*HyperV support is also included to run Free<span class="caps">BSD</span> as a guest on Microsoft&#8217;s virtualization&nbsp;platform.
*An overview of bhyve&#8217;s status was then given, including a demo of a Free<span class="caps">BSD</span> host running a Cent<span class="caps">OS</span> guest and an Ubuntu guest. The Cent<span class="caps">OS</span> <span class="caps">VM</span> was a pre-installed image and the Ubuntu <span class="caps">VM</span> was a new install. This showed that bhyve can support installation of VMs via <span class="caps">ISO</span> images thanks to the newly commit <span class="caps">AHCI</span> support. Currently bhyve only supports x86 as an architecture, but there are plans to support <span class="caps">ARM</span>; this is mainly due to resources avilable etc. bhyve shows a lot of promise and it will be great to see competition in the virtualization space on Free<span class="caps">BSD</span>, just like there is on&nbsp;Linux.</p>

<p>The afternoon was taken up by the Vendor session, where companies that support and use Free<span class="caps">BSD</span> gave presentations and discussed what was needed/wanted/missing/broken. The session was kicked of by the Free<span class="caps">BSD</span> Foundation. It&#8217;s always encouraging to see a Foundation show how well they are growing, and how they have helped the project.

Day 2 of EuroBSDCon (overview of [Day 1][1])kicked off for me with the morning being dedicated to virtualization. In Linux we're all used to the usual suspects - KVM/Xen/LXC/VMWare, so I was interested to hear what's available on FreeBSD especially [bhyve][2] which is probably as close to KVM as one will get.

 [2]: http://bhyve.org/ "The BSD Hypervisor"

*Xen support is available in FreeBSD, but only as DomU (guest VM). Dom0 (host server) support is actively being worked on though to rectify this shortfall (this does not apply to NetBSD). Xen PVHVM support is included in FreeBSD 10. 
*VMWare support is available for FreeBSD guests. 
*Not overly surprising LXC is not supported but FreeBSD does have Jails. 
*HyperV support is also included to run FreeBSD as a guest on Microsoft's virtualization platform.
*An overview of bhyve's status was then given, including a demo of a FreeBSD host running a CentOS guest and an Ubuntu guest. The CentOS VM was a pre-installed image and the Ubuntu VM was a new install. This showed that bhyve can support installation of VMs via ISO images thanks to the newly commit AHCI support. Currently bhyve only supports x86 as an architecture, but there are plans to support ARM; this is mainly due to resources avilable etc. bhyve shows a lot of promise and it will be great to see competition in the virtualization space on FreeBSD, just like there is on Linux.

The afternoon was taken up by the Vendor session, where companies that support and use FreeBSD gave presentations and discussed what was needed/wanted/missing/broken. The session was kicked of by the FreeBSD Foundation. It's always encouraging to see a Foundation show how well they are growing, and how they have helped the project. As an example, the FreeBSD Foundation funded [SuperPage support][2] on ARM. This was followed by an overview of a startup in Japan that focuses on FreeBSD consultancy services, many major Japanese companies are FreeBSD users including Sony (PS4) and Panasonic (I forget the products they ship with FreeBSD). After that there was the discussion session which started off with a brief overview of the upcoming version of FreeBSD - 10.0. FreeBSD 10 has switched to LLVM as the default backend compiler, using clang for both x86 and ARM. There will be GCC support but it will not be used by default, the target is GCC 4.9. A good overview of new features comming up in the soon to be released FreeBSD 10 can be found [here][3].

OK so I‚Äôve finally got round to getting this domain back up after nuking the server, problem is it isn‚Äôt back on the server but on my secondary and much less bandwidth friendly machine.¬† So if you want to download anything please be aware it will take¬†**much**¬†longer than it did in the past ;-)

As you can see (if you¬†[visit directly][2]¬†rather than through an rss reader) I am now running¬†[Storytlr][3].¬† Basically I was in the mood for a change and as I use twitter a lot now I thought it best to just pull all my inane ramblings on the net into one place.

<p>As part of my role at work I get to interact with various Open Source projects, and not all of them are Linux related.

As part of my role at work I get to interact with various Open Source projects, and not all of them are Linux related. This week I'm on the beautiful, historic, sunny and warm island of Malta attending [EuroBSDCon][0]. As you can work out from the name, it is the European gathering of BSD developers and users covering all the BSD variants like [FreeBSD][1]/[NetBSD][2]/[OpenBSD][3]/[PCBSD][4]/[Dragonfly][5]. I'm giving a talk on ARMv8 and AArch64 on Sunday, so hopefully that will go well, I'm somewhat nervous as I finished my slides before I left which is somewhat unusual.

 [5]: http://www.dragonflybsd.org/ "Dragonfly BSD"

The 4 day event is split in two, with the first couple of days being dedicated to BSD developers; all of day 1 and day 2 is dedicated to FreeBSD, and half of day 2 is dedicated to NetBSD. These developer sessions are targetted at the core developers, the guys and girls that commit code into the BSD repositories, are part of the core teams like security/maintanence/etc., and is a great insight into the workings and planning of their distributions. It's somewhat encouraging to see the BSD communities suffer from some of the same issues that afflict Linux, package name differences between distros being one. Having attended numerous distro related conferences (FUDCon/UDS/oSC), it was interesting to see how the FreeBSD camp do things - maybe useful to do something similar with oSC.

As with most conferences, the hall way track is priceless. I managed to catch up with a couple of the FreeBSD ARM developers and was enlightened to some interesting issues that they're experienceing, and got a good first hand account on the status of the port. 

There are about 150 attendees at the DevSummit, and it seems that the Dutch and Poles have invaded with a smattering of French (either they out number people or they're just noisey buggers :-) ). Unfortunately the M/F ratio is pretty poor, with only 2% women. Regardless the BSD crowd are a fun and interesting bunch, and I'm looking forward to working with the BSD community more.

By the way, [ARM][6] are [hiring][7]! If your on the market for a job, have a look and if you apply just say I sent you ;-)

<p>Ti in association with the PandaBoard community have kindly sponsored and are shipping several PandaBoards.</p>

<p>Thank you, this is a huge help.</p>

<p>Now that we have some devices on our way it doesn‚Äôt mean we can sit back and relax, we still need more devices. Yes, I‚Äôm going to say it again ‚Äì Please help the Geeko and donate as much or as little as you can (preferably not zero ;-) ).</p>

<p>So what else is new? Well openSUSE has managed to run on a couple of modern ARM devices. Joop Boonen¬†<a href="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/16098.png?skin_name=chrome">managed</a>¬†to get openSUSE running on his PandaBoard. He even made a couple of videos:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf5zKT2gWKs" title="First boot of openSUSE on a Pandaboard">First boot of openSUSE ARM port on Pandaboard</a></p>

<p>Michal Hru≈°eck√Ω¬†<a href="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/10/opensuse-asus-transformer/" title="Meet Optimus Geeko">managed</a>¬†to get openSUSE running on his ASUS Transformer Tablet (albeit in a chroot), he has also provided¬†<a href="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/10/opensuse-arm-chroot-less-then-alpha/" title="Pre-Alpha Geeko chroot">information</a>¬†on how to do this yourself if you‚Äôre feeling brave :-)</p>

<p>We still don‚Äôt have anything that we can release yet, as we are still working to fix packages. We are fighting forward and we will succeed!!</p>

    <p>Sorry that no news has been dished out with regards to the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> <span class="caps">ARM</span> porting effort, but that‚Äôs mostly because things have been busy&nbsp;(honest!)</p>

<p>For starters we have now successfully built around 3500 packages out of a total of about 4700 for the full open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> ditribution. So we are well on our way. It hasn‚Äôt been easy going though, and we still have lots of hurdles, hoops and obstacles to&nbsp;overcome.</p>

<p>Alex Graf has been beavering away into the small wee hours getting among things lots of fixes into qemu to help with builds, fixing kernel builds that I and Adrian Schroeter created, and generally being an engineering&nbsp;machine.</p>

<p>As I mentioned Adrian Schroeter has been busy with creating as generic a kernel as possible to be used in the <span class="caps">OBS</span> with qemu. He has also been busy fixing packages in association with Dirk Mueller, Reinhard Max and&nbsp;others.</p>

<p>Joop Boonen built u-boot and submitted it into the relevant devel project. So we now have the means to properly boot an <span class="caps">ARM</span> based&nbsp;system.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been busy building hardware specific kernels, which I‚Äôm still learning how to do properly. As it stands we have kernels built for Freescale powered EfikaMXs, Texas Instruments powered Pandboards <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Beagleboards, Nvidia powered Tegra2 devices (mainly Trimslice) and soon <span class="caps">ST</span>-Ericsson powered NovaThor devices like the&nbsp;Snowball.</p>

<p>Work is still on going, one really good thing is Kiwi support for <span class="caps">ARM</span> is being worked on. Marcus Schaefer has rolled his sleeves up and is attacking it with gusto, and making good progress. It is by no means a done deal, yet. It does show though how versatile open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>‚Äôs toolsets are. Hopefully it won‚Äôt be too long until we can get things working, and hey maybe even get those fine folks in <span class="caps">SUSE</span> Studio to add <span class="caps">ARM</span> as an architecture so that we can have highly customised <span class="caps">ARM</span> builds&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>As I also mentioned, the kernels aren‚Äôt perfect yet. So we still need to do more testing and fine tuning. One item that was identified (by Alex of course) was that we have an issue with unwinding. There is a ‚Äúhack‚Äù identified to get things working but a proper fix is still being&nbsp;sought.</p>

<p>We also have some exception handling issues which prevents us from builing Java and Java related apps which in turn are preventing us from building a lot of the remaining 1200 or so packages. We do still have some packages that need fixing which don‚Äôt require any of the exception crippled packages, so feel free to jump in&nbsp;;-)</p>

<p>There are some areas that still need some love on <span class="caps">ARM</span>, like hwinfo and also our darling Ya<span class="caps">ST.</span> X drivers are also a bit of a grey area, actually they‚Äôre more likely to be&nbsp;missing.</p>

<p>All in all we still have our work cut out for us, but we are making good progress. ¬†I can‚Äôt say when we will have working images for people to try, so don‚Äôt ask; but trust me, I will make sure to let you all know when we do. I am hoping to have something working in time for <span class="caps">FOSDEM</span> and hopefully show it off&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea of what we are using the hardware that has been donated so far: EfikaMXs are currently employed natively building packages, one of the issues we have with qemu is that it can be tempremental at times and isn‚Äôt suited really as a long term solution as it stands. So the EfikaMXs build all the the failed packages to make sure that qemu isn‚Äôt at fault ‚Äì we found a load of packages built, and as such were imported into the <span class="caps">OBS</span> to get things rolling on. They are also being used to help out with Kiwi support. Pandaboards are being used for testing and bug hunting mostly, but also for packaging.

    </div>

    <div class="title">
      <p>Storytelling with&nbsp;Storytlr</p>
    </div>

    <p>I thought it would be wise to document how I installed¬†<a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/" title="Life streaming">Storytlr</a>¬†as I feel the official¬†<a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/wiki/Install" title="Storytlr official documentation">documentation</a>¬†doesn‚Äôt list&nbsp;everything.</p>

<p>The basic requirements to get storytlr working are ‚Äì Apache, My<span class="caps">SQL</span>, <span class="caps">PHP5</span> (with php5-tidy, and php5-mcrypt).¬† So once you have the basic system requirements met, the next step is to download the latest stable release from¬†<a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/downloads/list" title="Download storytlr">here</a>¬†and extract the tarball in your target&nbsp;directory.</p>

<p>So in your virtual host file make sure you have&nbsp;enabled¬†<code>AllowOverride</code></p>

<p>(I set mine to <span class="caps">ALL</span>), this will mean that apache takes note of the .htaccess.¬† I also had to add¬†<code>Options FollowSymlinks</code> to the .htaccess, just underneath&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Next create your database using your preferred method (phpmyadmin/mysqladmin/voodoo).¬† Once created you need to populate it with the basic info,&nbsp;so¬†<code>cd¬†$PATH/TO/INSTALL/protected/install/</code></p>

<p>and run&nbsp;<code>mysql -u $USER -p -D $DB_NAME &lt; database.sql</code></p>

<p>So the database is ready and waiting for you now, next step is to edit the basic config&nbsp;information.</p>

<p>There is a sample file ready for you to edit, so first thing&nbsp;is¬†<code>cd $PATH/TO/INSTALL/protected/config/</code></p>

<p>and copy the&nbsp;sample¬†<code>cp config.ini.sample config.ini</code></p>

<p>Now open config.ini in your preferred editor. The key items to change&nbsp;are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>db.host=</code>  &lt;‚Äîyou can leave this if your database is running on the same host as you web&nbsp;server.</li>
<li><code>db.username=</code>  &lt;‚Äìenter the database username for the storytlr&nbsp;database.</li>
<li><code>db.password=</code>  &lt;‚Äìenter the database user password for the storytlr&nbsp;database.</li>
<li><code>db.dbname=</code>  &lt;‚Äìenter the database name for the storytlr&nbsp;database.</li>
<li><code>security.cookie=</code>   &lt;‚Äìyou can replace all or part of this if you wish, just make it different to what is there&nbsp;already.</li>
<li><code>web.host=</code>  &lt;‚Äìenter your desired web url without the http:// (i.e.&nbsp;stream.geeko.org).</li>
<li><code>web.timezone=</code>  &lt;‚Äìput your desired/local&nbsp;timezone.</li>
<li><code>debug=</code>  &lt;‚Äìit is advisable to change this to 1.  It will help you when you run into&nbsp;issues.</li>
<li><code>flickr.api_keys=</code>  &lt;‚Äìyou will need to add your api key here if you wish to use the flickr module.  You can get your key by heading <a href="http://flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/" title="Flikr key generation">here</a> </li>
<li><code>twitter.username=</code>  &lt;‚Äìadd your twitter credentials if you want items * to be posted to twitter (i.e. blog&nbsp;entries/etc)</li>
<li><code>twitter.password=</code>  &lt;‚Äìadd your twitter credentials if you want items to be posted to twitter (i.e. blog&nbsp;entries/etc)</li>
<li><code>gmap.key=</code>  &lt;‚Äì same as flickr you need to add your api key here to use the map functionality.  You can get your key from <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/" title="Google Maps key generation">here</a></li>
<li><code>default.timezone=</code>  &lt;‚Äìagain change it to your preferred/local timezone. If you‚Äôre not sure you can leave the default and change it via the admin&nbsp;panel.</li>
<li><code>default.timezoneid=</code>  &lt;‚Äìagain change it to your preferred/local timezone.  If you‚Äôre not sure you can leave the default and change it via the admin&nbsp;panel</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally make sure you web server has the correct permissions to access the&nbsp;files</p>

<p><code>chown -R wwwrun:www $PATH/TO/INSTALL</code> (replace <code>wwwrun:www</code> with whatever your distro uses if not on&nbsp;open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>).</p>

<p>So once all that is done just head over to your new site.  You can log in via the little key icon in the top right or just append /admin to your url.  The default credentials are <code>user=admin password=storytlr</code> please make sure you change the password once logged&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>So that‚Äôs the install done, what about making sure the feeds saty up to date?  Well the only way of doing that is to set up a cronjob, not painful at all but not as automated as I‚Äôd have liked.  I‚Äôve chosen to update every 7 minutes because there is so much going on in my web <span class="caps">2.0</span> life&nbsp;:-P</p>

<p>So basically choose your timing for updating your streams, and then run the update.php script located in the protected/tools directory telling it which user to update for.  My cronjob looks&nbsp;like:</p>

<p><code>*/7 * * * * php5 $PATH/TO/INSTALL/protected/tools/update.php admin</code></p>

<p>There are several additional plugins&nbsp;available:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/storytlr-plugin-github" title="Storytlr Github Plugin">Github</a> </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/storytlr-plugin-goodreads" title="Storytlr Goodreads Plugin">Goodreads</a> </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/storytlr-plugin-foursquare" title="Storytlr Foursquare Plugin">Foursquare</a> </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each plugin has instructions on how to install, but they are pretty simple.  In essence you‚Äôll need to do a git clone of the repository housing the plugin, rename the directory, add the database entries to you installation, copy the icon to the images directory, and off you go!  If you are interested in creating a new plugin, I recommend you look at John Hobbs‚Äô little <a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2010/01/19/writing-a-plugin-for-storytlr" title="Writing a plugin for Storytlr">guide</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://seg.phault.net/" title="The home of Segphault">Ryan Paul</a> of Ars Technica and Gwibber fame did a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/guides/2010/01/make-your-own-lifestream-with-open-source-software.ars" title="Ars Technica article on Storytlr">piece</a> on storytlr which pushed me to trying it.  As you can see from Ryan‚Äôs site he has implemented a few modifications like tangofying the icon set, and also looks like he created a Launchpad&nbsp;plugin.</p>

<p>I have a few issues but none of them are in anyway show stoppers, and I&#8217;m actually enjoying the simplicity of it all&nbsp;:-D</p>

I thought it would be wise to document how I installed¬†[Storytlr][1]¬†as I feel the official¬†[documentation][2]¬†doesn‚Äôt list everything.

 [1]: http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/ "Life streaming"
 [2]: http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/wiki/Install "Storytlr official documentation"

The basic requirements to get storytlr working are ‚Äì Apache, MySQL, PHP5 (with php5-tidy, and php5-mcrypt).¬† So once you have the basic system requirements met, the next step is to download the latest stable release from¬†[here][3]¬†and extract the tarball in your target directory.

 [3]: http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/downloads/list "Download storytlr"

So in your virtual host file make sure you have enabled¬†`AllowOverride`

(I set mine to ALL), this will mean that apache takes note of the .htaccess.¬† I also had to add¬†`Options FollowSymlinks` to the .htaccess, just underneath .

Next create your database using your preferred method (phpmyadmin/mysqladmin/voodoo).¬† Once created you need to populate it with the basic info, so¬†`cd¬†$PATH/TO/INSTALL/protected/install/`

and run `mysql -u $USER -p -D $DB_NAME < database.sql`

So the database is ready and waiting for you now, next step is to edit the basic config information.

There is a sample file ready for you to edit, so first thing is¬†`cd $PATH/TO/INSTALL/protected/config/`

and copy the sample¬†`cp config.ini.sample config.ini`

Now open config.ini in your preferred editor. The key items to change are:

* `db.host=`  <‚Äîyou can leave this if your database is running on the same host as you web server.
* `db.username=`  <‚Äìenter the database username for the storytlr database.
* `db.password=`  <‚Äìenter the database user password for the storytlr database.
* `db.dbname=`  <‚Äìenter the database name for the storytlr database.
* `security.cookie=`   <‚Äìyou can replace all or part of this if you wish, just make it different to what is there already.
* `web.host=`  <‚Äìenter your desired web url without the http:// (i.e. stream.geeko.org).
* `web.timezone=`  <‚Äìput your desired/local timezone.
* `debug=`  <‚Äìit is advisable to change this to 1.  It will help you when you run into issues.
* `flickr.api_keys=`  <‚Äìyou will need to add your api key here if you wish to use the flickr module.  You can get your key by heading [here][4] 
* `twitter.username=`  <‚Äìadd your twitter credentials if you want items * to be posted to twitter (i.e. blog entries/etc)
* `twitter.password=`  <‚Äìadd your twitter credentials if you want items to be posted to twitter (i.e. blog entries/etc)
* `gmap.key=`  <‚Äì same as flickr you need to add your api key here to use the map functionality.  You can get your key from [here][5]
* `default.timezone=`  <‚Äìagain change it to your preferred/local timezone. If you‚Äôre not sure you can leave the default and change it via the admin panel.
* `default.timezoneid=`  <‚Äìagain change it to your preferred/local timezone.  If you‚Äôre not sure you can leave the default and change it via the admin panel

 [4]: http://flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/ "Flikr key generation"
 [5]: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/ "Google Maps key generation"

Finally make sure you web server has the correct permissions to access the files

`chown -R wwwrun:www $PATH/TO/INSTALL` (replace `wwwrun:www` with whatever your distro uses if not on openSUSE).

So once all that is done just head over to your new site.  You can log in via the little key icon in the top right or just append /admin to your url.  The default credentials are `user=admin password=storytlr` please make sure you change the password once logged in.

So that‚Äôs the install done, what about making sure the feeds saty up to date?  Well the only way of doing that is to set up a cronjob, not painful at all but not as automated as I‚Äôd have liked.  I‚Äôve chosen to update every 7 minutes because there is so much going on in my web 2.0 life :-P

So basically choose your timing for updating your streams, and then run the update.php script located in the protected/tools directory telling it which user to update for.  My cronjob looks like:

`*/7 * * * * php5 $PATH/TO/INSTALL/protected/tools/update.php admin `

There are several additional plugins available:

* [Github][6] 

* [Goodreads][7] 

* [Foursquare][8]

 [7]: http://github.com/jmhobbs/storytlr-plugin-goodreads "Storytlr Goodreads Plugin"
 [8]: http://github.com/jmhobbs/storytlr-plugin-foursquare "Storytlr Foursquare Plugin"

Each plugin has instructions on how to install, but they are pretty simple.  In essence you‚Äôll need to do a git clone of the repository housing the plugin, rename the directory, add the database entries to you installation, copy the icon to the images directory, and off you go!  If you are interested in creating a new plugin, I recommend you look at John Hobbs‚Äô little [guide][9].

 [9]: http://www.velvetcache.org/2010/01/19/writing-a-plugin-for-storytlr "Writing a plugin for Storytlr"

[Ryan Paul][10] of Ars Technica and Gwibber fame did a [piece][11] on storytlr which pushed me to trying it.  As you can see from Ryan‚Äôs site he has implemented a few modifications like tangofying the icon set, and also looks like he created a Launchpad plugin.

After five years at [Fujitsu][1] it is time for me to move on. I‚Äôve had a blast, both good and bad, whilst there and was lucky enough to have experienced and hopefully learnt a lot. Whist there I‚Äôve worked in all sorts of verticals; including but not limited to Government, Financial, Education, Science and HPC. Although I was brought in to deal with Linux and Open Source it was never limited to that and was lucky enough to have been exposed to a multitude of technologies that I wouldn‚Äôt have known about had it not been due to work.

 [1]: http://www.fujitsu.com/uk/ "Fujitsu UK"

I‚Äôm no longer going to be based from home, but will be based out of the fine city of Cambridge working for [ARM][2]. As for what I‚Äôm going to do exactly, all I‚Äôll say is that it is going to be very much Open Source related (which makes me happier than a pig in poo!). I will be on leave until I start my new role, which is when I‚Äôll tell more.

      <p>open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> <span class="caps">ARM</span> Port update&nbsp;21122011</p>
    </div>

    <p>It‚Äôs been almost a month since the last <span class="caps">ARM</span> porting update so here‚Äôs a little christmas present to you&nbsp;all.</p>

<p>Dirk M√ºller¬†<a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm/2011-12/msg00017.html">sent</a>¬†out a status update to the mailing list, but I thought it would be a good idea post here for you scoundrels that aren‚Äôt subscribed&nbsp;:-) </p>

<p>Thanks to some great work by loads of people including (but not limited to) Alex Graf, Adrian Schr√∂ter, Dirk M√ºller, Marcus Sch√§fer, Joop Boonen open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>‚Äôs <span class="caps">ARM</span> port has come along nicely. ¬†We are now at about 4200 successful packages out of a total of around 4700 for a complete distro, an increase of roughly 700&nbsp;packages.</p>

<p>There are some localised issues for <span class="caps">ARM</span> but they are much much fewer than before. As we are building against Factory we naturally are affected by Factory‚Äôs occaisional desire to break for the sake of breaking, but again those breakages are realtively&nbsp;few.</p>

<p>Marcus has managed to get Kiwi support to build <span class="caps">ARM</span> images (with a patch or two from Joop); Kiwi can run on Pandaboards, and also generate suitable images for for Pandaboards ‚Äì the other boards and devices will come later. Alex, Dirk and Adrian have been busy beavering away as usual with package fixes, improvements to qemu and general <span class="caps">OBS</span> tweaks; they have also got the internal <span class="caps">ARM</span> <span class="caps">OBS</span> instance into a great shape, this is distributed between the N√ºrnberg and Prague offices and the nodes comprise of Efika<span class="caps">MX</span>, Pandaboard <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Beagleboard. It basically builds factory in parrelel to the public <span class="caps">OBS</span> but generally is more successful due to running on native hardware, whereas the public instance uses qemu which sometimes doesn‚Äôt want to play nicely in the playground; we (well <span class="caps">OK</span> Alex) can then look at getting a fix for qemu or we import the succesful package into the <span class="caps">OBS</span> can move on. I‚Äôm still battling with kernels for the Snowball, but I think I‚Äôm almost&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>One of the bigger issues we have is that there is no graphics support, if you think graphics issues on x86 based systems is a pain wait till you look at it on <span class="caps">ARM</span>! ;-) This is being worked on so it‚Äôs just a matter of time, there are ways and means around it but they are far from&nbsp;elegant.</p>

<p>As everyone likes videos, Joop has created another great¬†<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7iG06hJzGI">video</a>¬†showing open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> running on a Pandaboard (Joop uses one of those aforementioned ways &amp; means to get graphics working) and Michal Hru≈°eck√Ω has a¬†<a href="https://plus.google.com/113898425601074911439/posts/2DmvCRCWCyP?hl=en-GB">video</a>¬†showing open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> on his Asus Transformer Tablet (yes it‚Äôs still in a chroot but look at that ncurses yummyness :-)&nbsp;)</p>

<p>Just to remind you that you will be able to see first hand some of the <span class="caps">ARM</span> porting goodness at <span class="caps">FOSDEM</span> in Febuary so make sure you come along ;-) Till the next update, have a fun and Geeko filled&nbsp;time.</p>

It‚Äôs been almost a month since the last ARM porting update so here‚Äôs a little christmas present to you all.

Dirk M√ºller¬†[sent][1]¬†out a status update to the mailing list, but I thought it would be a good idea post here for you scoundrels that aren‚Äôt subscribed :-) 

 [1]: http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm/2011-12/msg00017.html

Thanks to some great work by loads of people including (but not limited to) Alex Graf, Adrian Schr√∂ter, Dirk M√ºller, Marcus Sch√§fer, Joop Boonen openSUSE‚Äôs ARM port has come along nicely. ¬†We are now at about 4200 successful packages out of a total of around 4700 for a complete distro, an increase of roughly 700 packages.

There are some localised issues for ARM but they are much much fewer than before. As we are building against Factory we naturally are affected by Factory‚Äôs occaisional desire to break for the sake of breaking, but again those breakages are realtively few.

Marcus has managed to get Kiwi support to build ARM images (with a patch or two from Joop); Kiwi can run on Pandaboards, and also generate suitable images for for Pandaboards ‚Äì the other boards and devices will come later. Alex, Dirk and Adrian have been busy beavering away as usual with package fixes, improvements to qemu and general OBS tweaks; they have also got the internal ARM OBS instance into a great shape, this is distributed between the N√ºrnberg and Prague offices and the nodes comprise of EfikaMX, Pandaboard & Beagleboard. It basically builds factory in parrelel to the public OBS but generally is more successful due to running on native hardware, whereas the public instance uses qemu which sometimes doesn‚Äôt want to play nicely in the playground; we (well OK Alex) can then look at getting a fix for qemu or we import the succesful package into the OBS can move on. I‚Äôm still battling with kernels for the Snowball, but I think I‚Äôm almost there.

One of the bigger issues we have is that there is no graphics support, if you think graphics issues on x86 based systems is a pain wait till you look at it on ARM! ;-) This is being worked on so it‚Äôs just a matter of time, there are ways and means around it but they are far from elegant.

As everyone likes videos, Joop has created another great¬†[video][4]¬†showing openSUSE running on a Pandaboard (Joop uses one of those aforementioned ways & means to get graphics working) and Michal Hru≈°eck√Ω has a¬†[video][5]¬†showing openSUSE on his Asus Transformer Tablet (yes it‚Äôs still in a chroot but look at that ncurses yummyness :-) )

Continuing my series of getting the openSUSE Community engaged in how better to improve itself, I thought I would look at Transparency and Communication.¬† So what do I mean by these two?

If we look at the definitions of these two: 
[Transparency][1]¬†- Lack of hidden agendas¬† and conditions, accompanied by the availability¬† of full¬† information¬† required¬† for collaboration, cooperation, and collective decision making. 
Minimum degree of disclosure to which agreements, dealings, practices, and transactions are open to all for verification. 
Essential condition for a free and open exchange whereby the rules and reasons behind regulatory measures are fair and clear to all participants.

 [1]: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/transparency.html "Definition of Transparency"

[Communication][2]¬†- Two-way process¬† of reaching mutual¬† understanding, in which participants¬† not only exchange¬† (encode-decode) information¬† but also create¬† and share¬† meaning.

 [2]: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/communication.html "Definition of Communication"

Okay so nothing earth shattering, which is good in so much as it should be relatively easy to attain.¬† No need for spiritual enlightenment.¬† One question I have is, how well do you think openSUSE is at achieving both of these?¬† Personally I think we have come leaps and bounds, but we can still improve (we can always improve ;-) ).

The building of the distribution is done in the open on the OBS, we get regular status updates from the chirpy and cheerful¬†[Coolo][4]¬†on where we are at and what is causing issues.¬† The Board conducts its meeting in the open on irc in #opensuse-project.¬† All the teams conduct their meetings in the open on irc for that matter, well those that have meetings ‚Äì GNOME shall be resuming the regular meetings shortly.

 [4]: http://www.kdedevelopers.org/blog/124 "Coolo's Blog"

We have multiple methods of communication available ‚Äì Mailing lists, IRC, Forums & the booths at events.

So on the whole I think we are communicating well, but are we communicating the right information and is it **all** the information?¬† That‚Äôs where I would like your input :-) ¬† My Only complaint I have is something that pretty much everyone who is passionate suffers from ‚Äì we sometimes let our mouths run off and end up trying to flame someone.¬† Being passionate is great, don‚Äôt ever loose the passion.¬† We just need to harness it, don‚Äôt let it go too wild.¬† Also we need to try and be more respectful to others, not just people but projects and distros.¬† Whether you agree with them or not, there is no need to start throwing abuse or any form of nastiness.¬† By all means disagree with them but do so in a calm and collected manner, you will be respected for it much more.¬† If you do get carried away, then for goodness sake admit it and apologise!¬† Everyone is guilty of this to an extent, myself included.

As many know, I have a few Android devices, and I know a lot of other openSUSE fans out there also have robot powered devices.¬† I decided the other day to try something during my lunch break ‚Äì create a widget to show how many days left till 11.4‚Ä≤s release.

Yeah I know it isn‚Äôt an earth shattering application, but I‚Äôm not a code monkey, so any working code I generate is a serious plus for me ;-)

So my lunchtime project was inspired by the efforts of someone at Ubuntu who was doing the same for their Natty release.¬† I used this¬†[tutorial][2]¬†to help get me going.¬† I now present to you oSRCD ‚Äì the openSUSE Release CountDown.

<li>  <span class="caps">1.0.5</span> mostly an update to their original&nbsp;release</li>
<li>  <span class="caps">1.1.0</span> the new release with new <span class="caps">API</span>, and renaming most&nbsp;packages</li>
</ul>

<p>So where is Smeegol? ¬†Well we‚Äôre pretty much there, although not 100%. ¬†I have <span class="caps">1.0.5</span> all built and packaged including an image. ¬†Problem is I seem to have hit a bug with network-manager-netbook ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt seem to be displaying networks which is a fairly fundamental issue&nbsp;:-(</p>

<p>I have also got <span class="caps">1.1.0</span> built, but for factory only atm ‚Äì I‚Äôm having some issues with tracker on <span class="caps">11.3.</span> ¬†Problem is when I try and run the image, I basically have an unusable system thanks to some Gconf fubar but I don‚Äôt really know&nbsp;what.</p>

<p>You may have also noticed that I‚Äôm still calling it Smeegol ;-) Well the simple reason is I have requested clarification from MeeGo, Nokia, Intel and the Linux Foundation and so far I‚Äôve received bubkiss!! ¬†I heard loads of talk from the recent MeeGo Conference about how open MeeGo was, but it seems that they are only open to partners who can help them make money; not open to the wider community. ¬†I am not alone in waiting for a response from them, Fedora and Debian are also in limbo waiting for information/clarification and general communication from them. ¬†The difference between us is the fact that in open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> if you want something done the best way is to Just Do It&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, before I make an official release of either I need people to test and report back to me what does and doesn‚Äôt work. ¬†I haven‚Äôt tried doing an upgrade from <span class="caps">1.0.3</span> to <span class="caps">1.0.5</span> or <span class="caps">1.1.0</span> so maybe someone could try that. ¬†Jump onto #opensuse-moblin on Freenode or the opensuse-goblin mailing list and let‚Äôs continue to be trail blazers.

<p>I would really love to get both releases out as a little christmas present to you the community, so who‚Äôs up for some festive&nbsp;fun?</p>

Looks like it‚Äôs been a while since I mentioned anything about our dear friend Smeegol ‚Äì sorry.

As most will know MeeGo made a couple of releases:

*   1.1.0 the new release with new API, and renaming most packages

So where is Smeegol? ¬†Well we‚Äôre pretty much there, although not 100%. ¬†I have 1.0.5 all built and packaged including an image. ¬†Problem is I seem to have hit a bug with network-manager-netbook ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt seem to be displaying networks which is a fairly fundamental issue :-(

I have also got 1.1.0 built, but for factory only atm ‚Äì I‚Äôm having some issues with tracker on 11.3. ¬†Problem is when I try and run the image, I basically have an unusable system thanks to some Gconf fubar but I don‚Äôt really know what.

Get openSUSE 12.3

Now that openSUSE 12.3 is out, the [openSUSE ARM Team][3] want to step up a gear. As the cycle was shorter than normal, there are a few wrinkles that need to be ironed out and also a whole heap of new things that can be added. After some discussion at FOSDEM, it was decided to hold a Hackathon to address these items. The Hackathon will take place on 08 to 12 April, both at the SUSE offices in Nuremberg as well as online for those that can‚Äôt attend in person.

 [3]: https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM "openSUSE on ARM"

We have a TODO list which comprises the following:

*   ¬†AArch64 fixes for 12.3 & Factory
*   ¬†Resolve outstanding 12.3 package issues
*   ¬†Test and release 12.3 images
*   ¬†Create OpenStack images for¬†ARM
*   ¬†Get KVM and Xen on Chromebook & Arndale running
*   ¬†OBS improvements

There will also be the opportunity for new device bring up for those that want to, but our intention is to work through and complete as much of the above TODO list as possible first. For those interested in joining in the fun, please either join us in Nuremberg and/or join the [opensuse-arm mailing list][4], the [#opensuse-arm][5] IRC channel on Freenode and also keep an eye on the [openSUSE on ARM Trello board][6].

    <div class="title">
      <p>A Galaxy In My&nbsp;Pocket</p>
    </div>

    <p>Yet again I get a dose of the Early Adopter jitters ‚Äì I tried to hold out but I just couldn‚Äôt. I went and got me some shiny robot lovin‚Äô from Korea, and boy do I love this particular droid ‚Äì the fabulous (<span class="caps">IMHO</span>) Samsung <span class="caps">GT</span>-<span class="caps">P1000</span> better known as the Galaxy&nbsp;Tab.</p>

<p>This is my third dedicated Android device, the first being the Motorola Milestone 11months ago, followed by the Nexus One around Easter time this year. I kind of understand why some people end up with so many Apple devices now&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>I‚Äôve got a lot I want to say about the device, so I‚Äôll be breaking it down into multiple&nbsp;posts.</p>

<p>So why the heck did I go for it? Well I had specific requirements from a tablet styled&nbsp;device:</p>

<ol>
<li> It needs to be easily portable. Yes my netbook is portable in comparison to my laptop, but I need some form of bag even for it. Also it weighs a bit too, and isn‚Äôt easy to use one&nbsp;handed.</li>
<li> It needs to have good media support. Yeah, I‚Äôm talking about that thing we all love to hate ‚Äì codec proliferation!! Also screen quality helps here too as does audio&nbsp;quality.</li>
<li> Good network support. Basically I don‚Äôt want to have to worry about buggering around setting up bluetooth pairings, hooking up cables&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li> Good applicatipon ecosystem. I want to be able to get applications that I want and need easily and conveniently without being tied to a big old school&nbsp;machine.</li>
<li> Video calling support. This isn‚Äôt vital, but it is pretty damned close to it. Both my wife‚Äôs and my family is pretty much disperesed across three out of four corners of the globe, and being able to do some form of video calling not only makes staying in touch cheaper, but we also get to see each other‚Äôs ugly&nbsp;mugs.</li>
<li> Some light relief. This can be in the form of games or other&nbsp;methods.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think they‚Äôre fairly reasonable requirements.¬† So how does the Tab meet my six simple&nbsp;requirements?</p>

<ol>
<li> The device is about the same size (height <span class="amp">&amp;</span> width) as one of those weird paper book things (/me was horrified how long ago I last read a physical book :-/), and about as thick as a cheque book. I sits very comfortably in one hand, and I can easily grip hold of it wrapping my fingers around both sides. It is also fairly light, it only starts to get heavy after about 45-60mins or so of single handed&nbsp;holding.</li>
<li> It shines beautifully with media playback. It has native support for Divx which means anything my <span class="caps">PS3</span> can play so can my Tab (almost all my DVDs are ripped so that I can easily watch them on any device). The 7 inch screen is great for watching films or web based video. Very clear and crisp and just generally great. Samsung‚Äôs video player is also great. I‚Äôm not sure if it is the same as on the Galaxy S as I haven‚Äôt really seen or used one of them, but the controls are very good and not intrusive. The music player is by far one of the best I‚Äôve used on Android. The little touch of being able to access it using a drop down mini version whilst the screen is locked is great. My only grumble here is that I can‚Äôt get it to scrobble to Last.fm, not a huge issue, but&nbsp;still‚Ä¶</li>
<li> Well believe it or not this tablet can also be a phone. It has full telephony functionality, the same as my Milestone or Nexus One. So that means I can get onto the net pretty much anywhere. Yes it also has wireless support as one would hope. So now I can always get online when I need to. Also as it is running <span class="caps">2.2</span> Froyo, I have the mobile hotspot functionality (I hate the sound of MiFi) so any of my devices can connect through it sans&nbsp;cables.</li>
<li> I know some people are going to rip the Android Marketplace a new arsehole, but seriously, have you tried Ovi from Nokia? Personally I have not had any issues using the Marketplace, apps are grouped fairly sensibly, details on the apps are fairly correct, it‚Äôs easy to go to the apps‚Äô homepage and contact the developer. Oh and it has almost all the apps I&nbsp;want/need.</li>
<li> It has a <span class="caps">1.3MP</span> front facing camera which you can use for either still photos ‚Äì self portrait style ‚Äì or video calling. The only issue here is getting cross platform applications. Yes Skype is available but it doesn‚Äôt support video calls from Android (yet?). I‚Äôm not aware of being able to use the Gmail video chat thingy yet (also don‚Äôt really know anyone using it). The only one that I‚Äôm aware of atm is Yahoo! which is a shame as most people I know have moved off of Yahoo and onto other services. But the main thing is the hardware is in&nbsp;place.</li>
<li> Well there are plenty of games available for android devices, some not so good, but some are very good, and they look great on the large sharp screen. Samsung have partnered with Gameloft to provide some ‚Äò<span class="caps">HD</span>‚Äô games, and on the whole these games are pretty good ‚Äì <span class="caps">NOVA</span> is preinstalled, a <span class="caps">FPS</span> Doom style game which I like; I bought Let‚Äôs Golf for some sporting sillyness, Dragon Hunter for some D&amp;Desque fantasy <span class="caps">RPG</span>, and Asphalt5 for some accelerometer fun. They all look and play pretty sweetly on the Tab. There are more titles available and all titles are available for trial. Samsung also bundle in an ebook reader that accepts any epub publications you may have. It looks and behave just like the paper based ones, even with the sound <span class="amp">&amp;</span> visual effects of turning pages. They also have their ‚ÄúReaderHub‚Äù app, this holds three apps inside ‚Äì a Newspaper app powered by PressDisplay, an Book app powered by Kobo, and a Magazine app powered by Zinio.

;T;	I"U# 

Yet again I get a dose of the Early Adopter jitters ‚Äì I tried to hold out but I just couldn‚Äôt. I went and got me some shiny robot lovin‚Äô from Korea, and boy do I love this particular droid ‚Äì the fabulous (IMHO) Samsung GT-P1000 better known as the Galaxy Tab.

This is my third dedicated Android device, the first being the Motorola Milestone 11months ago, followed by the Nexus One around Easter time this year. I kind of understand why some people end up with so many Apple devices now :-)

I‚Äôve got a lot I want to say about the device, so I‚Äôll be breaking it down into multiple posts.

So why the heck did I go for it? Well I had specific requirements from a tablet styled device:

1.  It needs to be easily portable. Yes my netbook is portable in comparison to my laptop, but I need some form of bag even for it. Also it weighs a bit too, and isn‚Äôt easy to use one handed.
2.  It needs to have good media support. Yeah, I‚Äôm talking about that thing we all love to hate ‚Äì codec proliferation!! Also screen quality helps here too as does audio quality.
3.  Good network support. Basically I don‚Äôt want to have to worry about buggering around setting up bluetooth pairings, hooking up cables etc.
4.  Good applicatipon ecosystem. I want to be able to get applications that I want and need easily and conveniently without being tied to a big old school machine.
5.  Video calling support. This isn‚Äôt vital, but it is pretty damned close to it. Both my wife‚Äôs and my family is pretty much disperesed across three out of four corners of the globe, and being able to do some form of video calling not only makes staying in touch cheaper, but we also get to see each other‚Äôs ugly mugs.
6.  Some light relief. This can be in the form of games or other methods.

I think they‚Äôre fairly reasonable requirements.¬† So how does the Tab meet my six simple requirements?

1.  The device is about the same size (height & width) as one of those weird paper book things (/me was horrified how long ago I last read a physical book :-/), and about as thick as a cheque book. I sits very comfortably in one hand, and I can easily grip hold of it wrapping my fingers around both sides. It is also fairly light, it only starts to get heavy after about 45-60mins or so of single handed holding.
2.  It shines beautifully with media playback. It has native support for Divx which means anything my PS3 can play so can my Tab (almost all my DVDs are ripped so that I can easily watch them on any device). The 7 inch screen is great for watching films or web based video. Very clear and crisp and just generally great. Samsung‚Äôs video player is also great. I‚Äôm not sure if it is the same as on the Galaxy S as I haven‚Äôt really seen or used one of them, but the controls are very good and not intrusive. The music player is by far one of the best I‚Äôve used on Android. The little touch of being able to access it using a drop down mini version whilst the screen is locked is great. My only grumble here is that I can‚Äôt get it to scrobble to Last.fm, not a huge issue, but still‚Ä¶
3.  Well believe it or not this tablet can also be a phone. It has full telephony functionality, the same as my Milestone or Nexus One. So that means I can get onto the net pretty much anywhere. Yes it also has wireless support as one would hope. So now I can always get online when I need to. Also as it is running 2.2 Froyo, I have the mobile hotspot functionality (I hate the sound of MiFi) so any of my devices can connect through it sans cables.
4.  I know some people are going to rip the Android Marketplace a new arsehole, but seriously, have you tried Ovi from Nokia? Personally I have not had any issues using the Marketplace, apps are grouped fairly sensibly, details on the apps are fairly correct, it‚Äôs easy to go to the apps‚Äô homepage and contact the developer. Oh and it has almost all the apps I want/need.
5.  It has a 1.3MP front facing camera which you can use for either still photos ‚Äì self portrait style ‚Äì or video calling. The only issue here is getting cross platform applications. Yes Skype is available but it doesn‚Äôt support video calls from Android (yet?). I‚Äôm not aware of being able to use the Gmail video chat thingy yet (also don‚Äôt really know anyone using it). The only one that I‚Äôm aware of atm is Yahoo! which is a shame as most people I know have moved off of Yahoo and onto other services. But the main thing is the hardware is in place.
6.  Well there are plenty of games available for android devices, some not so good, but some are very good, and they look great on the large sharp screen. Samsung have partnered with Gameloft to provide some ‚ÄòHD‚Äô games, and on the whole these games are pretty good ‚Äì NOVA is preinstalled, a FPS Doom style game which I like; I bought Let‚Äôs Golf for some sporting sillyness, Dragon Hunter for some D&Desque fantasy RPG, and Asphalt5 for some accelerometer fun. They all look and play pretty sweetly on the Tab. There are more titles available and all titles are available for trial. Samsung also bundle in an ebook reader that accepts any epub publications you may have. It looks and behave just like the paper based ones, even with the sound & visual effects of turning pages. They also have their ‚ÄúReaderHub‚Äù app, this holds three apps inside ‚Äì a Newspaper app powered by PressDisplay, an Book app powered by Kobo, and a Magazine app powered by Zinio. All three of these work brilliantly and have a \*huge\* amount of content available. I‚Äôll stop there for now, and try and get the next post up soon. In a nutshell if you‚Äôre wondering whether to get one or not and you ask me what do I think, my answer is YES get one. I‚Äôve had mine now for almost two weeks and I don‚Äôt regret it at all. My wife actually likes it, and my children have added ‚ÄúTab‚Äù into their vocabulary (and no I don‚Äôt meant the cigarette end, or the march with backpacks and full battle gear).¬† Oh and Angry Birds is stunning on the bigger screen :-)

So that‚Äôs it for now, I‚Äôll come back with some more soon. If there‚Äôs anything in particular people would like to know, just shout.

      <p>Target <span class="caps">ARM</span>&nbsp;Hardware</p>
    </div>

    <p>I just sent this into the¬†<a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm" title="openSUSE ARM Mailing list">-arm mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>This is a hot topic, and one that seems to generate the most&nbsp;noise.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had a discussion with several people about target hardware, and I‚Äôve also looked at what our peers are doing and saying. At the same time I‚Äôve been trying to see what options we have for getting some sponsorship for&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>There were three devices in the running, all are classed as development boards ‚Äì so no case or external prettyness (beauty comes from within&nbsp;anyway):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pandaboard.org/" title="TI's PanadaBoard"><span class="caps">TI</span>&nbsp;PandaBoard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.origenboard.org/" title="Samsung's Origen Board">Samsung&nbsp;Origen</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.igloocommunity.org/" title="ST Ericsson's Snowball Board"><span class="caps">ST</span> Ericsson&nbsp;Snowball</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After discussing, the preferred nominee is the PandaBoard. Several factors led to this decision, it has an integrated wired network connection; is well supported by the incumbant distros; widely used within the wider <span class="caps">ARM</span> open source community; and it has Pandas (<span class="caps">OK</span> only in name but&nbsp;still!)</p>

<p>So if you want to prep and get some hardware, then go for the PandaBoard (as soon as the Cortex <span class="caps">A15</span> is released, we‚Äôll be looking at&nbsp;them).</p>

<p>Yes, I know it‚Äôs a developer board and not an end user product. Unfortunately there aren‚Äôt actually that many end user products that you can sensibly use for development at the moment. Sure, there‚Äôs the¬†<a href="http://trimslice.com/" title="Tegra2 powered "Desktop"">TrimSlice</a>the¬†<a href="http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/t-dreamplugdetails.aspx" title="Plug Computer">DreamPlug</a>¬†and a few others, but after consulting someone that is far more knowledgable and aware of the wider landscape, we went with their&nbsp;recommendations.</p>

<p>Oh and things are moving pretty fast folk!!&nbsp;o/</p>

I just sent this into the¬†[-arm mailing list][1].

 [1]: http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm "openSUSE ARM Mailing list"

This is a hot topic, and one that seems to generate the most noise.

I‚Äôve had a discussion with several people about target hardware, and I‚Äôve also looked at what our peers are doing and saying. At the same time I‚Äôve been trying to see what options we have for getting some sponsorship for hardware.

There were three devices in the running, all are classed as development boards ‚Äì so no case or external prettyness (beauty comes from within anyway):

* [TI PandaBoard][2]
* [Samsung Origen][3]
* [ST Ericsson Snowball][4]

 [2]: http://www.pandaboard.org/ "TI's PanadaBoard"
 [3]: http://www.origenboard.org/ "Samsung's Origen Board"
 [4]: http://www.igloocommunity.org/ "ST Ericsson's Snowball Board"

After discussing, the preferred nominee is the PandaBoard. Several factors led to this decision, it has an integrated wired network connection; is well supported by the incumbant distros; widely used within the wider ARM open source community; and it has Pandas (OK only in name but still!)

So if you want to prep and get some hardware, then go for the PandaBoard (as soon as the Cortex A15 is released, we‚Äôll be looking at them).

Yes, I know it‚Äôs a developer board and not an end user product. Unfortunately there aren‚Äôt actually that many end user products that you can sensibly use for development at the moment. Sure, there‚Äôs the¬†[TrimSlice][5]the¬†[DreamPlug][6]¬†and a few others, but after consulting someone that is far more knowledgable and aware of the wider landscape, we went with their recommendations.

    <div class="title">
      <p>Smeegol NoGo MeeGo&nbsp;GoGo</p>
    </div>

    <p>As many people will know I‚Äôve spent around 18 months of my spare time packaging and building the Netbook <span class="caps">UX</span> for Moblin/MeeGo on open<span class="caps">SUSE.</span>¬† Not on my own, but with a community around me. I would just like to say a huge thank you to that community, you‚Äôve been great and spurred me on when I felt like the whole world was conspiring against&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>Sound a bit morose? Well in a way it is. Basically by all accounts MeeGo is stopping all work on the Netbook <span class="caps">UX.</span> Yup, all our hard work is now almost for nothing&nbsp;:-(</p>

<p>The first piece of evidence is the¬†<a href="http://wiki.meego.com/Release_Engineering/Plans/1.2" title="MeeGo Release Engineering Pans for 1.2">Release Engineering Plans for <span class="caps">1.2</span></a>.¬† If you look at the bottom, you‚Äôll notice that the Netbook doesn‚Äôt get any mention in Features, just bugs. Actually the same is for the <span class="caps">1.1</span> release.¬† In all honesty, the biggest change between <span class="caps">1.1</span> and its predecessor is that all refernces to Moblin was replaced with MeeGo. The next piece of info came at the fabulous <span class="caps">FOSDEM</span> <span class="caps">XI</span> (I‚Äôll do a seperate post on the event later). I spoke to several people directly and indirectly involved with MeeGo, especially the Netbook <span class="caps">UX</span>, about the lack of info on the Netbook <span class="caps">UX.</span> Each one of them said the same thing ‚Äì MeeGo is putting the Netbook <span class="caps">UX</span> into Maintanence Mode, stopping any further development on it, and only providing bug fixes for major issues.¬† I asked if there was going to be any announcement, basically the answer was nothing official. They‚Äôre just going to let it drift away ‚Äì just like netbooks themselves&nbsp;have.</p>

<p>There are most likely a huge number of reasons, which is fair enough. I was given a couple of reasons ‚Äì 1: Netbooks arent selling anymore, the Netbook ship didn‚Äôt really sail away, but was sunk. 2: MeeGo doesn‚Äôt want to invest anymore time or effort in gtk development, and wants to concentrate on Qt. Now I take this last one with a tiny bit of salt, only because both Intel and Nokia employ (or at least did so) a sizable team of <span class="caps">GNOME</span> developers. Saying that though, if they want to keep a roof over their heads they have to do what their employer says, and both originally started working with touch devices. So it does make sense as much as it&nbsp;doesn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>So, I herby give immediate notice that I am now no longer going to be doing any further work on the MeeGo <span class="caps">UX</span> for open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> or anyone else.¬† I wont delete the repo for <span class="caps">1.0</span> but will clear out the <span class="caps">1.1</span> and <span class="caps">1.2</span> repos that I had ‚Äì might as well give those resources back :-) Now if anyone would like to continue what I and others had started, then let me know and I would be more than&nbsp;happy.</p>

<p>I cant say what the other distros are going to do, I‚Äôve spoken to my counter part in Fedora, and they‚Äôre having a think about it as they were busting their chops to get things in for the <span class="caps">F15</span> release.¬† Either way I wish all involved&nbsp;luck.</p>

<p>Now before any of you conspiracy theory junkies get worked up ‚Äì this has nothing to do with the whole MeeGo Trademark issue that Smeegol had with the Linux Foundation.¬† As it happens I was due to have a conversation with the Linux Foundation about the issues between us and them, but have had to re-schedule due to travel constraints from one party or the other.¬† I still intend to speak with the <span class="caps">LF</span> about the issues, as they are still present in the other <span class="caps">UX</span>‚Äôs that they are&nbsp;developing.</p>

<p>So it‚Äôs time for me to close off and say, so long and thanks for all the fish! I‚Äôll still be around, I‚Äôll probably start getting back into the <span class="caps">GNOME</span> swing of things, and help fcrozat with <span class="caps">GNOME3</span> etc.¬† Oh and I‚Äôve got a lunatic idea for a project which I intend to kick off (stay tuned ;-)&nbsp;).</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.meego.com/MeeGo_Style_Guide#Trademark_Usage" title="MeeGo's Trademark Usage">MeeGo is a trademark of the Linux Foundation</a>.</p>

;T;	I"Ë# 

As many people will know I‚Äôve spent around 18 months of my spare time packaging and building the Netbook UX for Moblin/MeeGo on openSUSE.¬† Not on my own, but with a community around me. I would just like to say a huge thank you to that community, you‚Äôve been great and spurred me on when I felt like the whole world was conspiring against me.

Sound a bit morose? Well in a way it is. Basically by all accounts MeeGo is stopping all work on the Netbook UX. Yup, all our hard work is now almost for nothing :-(

The first piece of evidence is the¬†[Release Engineering Plans for 1.2][2].¬† If you look at the bottom, you‚Äôll notice that the Netbook doesn‚Äôt get any mention in Features, just bugs. Actually the same is for the 1.1 release.¬† In all honesty, the biggest change between 1.1 and its predecessor is that all refernces to Moblin was replaced with MeeGo. The next piece of info came at the fabulous FOSDEM XI (I‚Äôll do a seperate post on the event later). I spoke to several people directly and indirectly involved with MeeGo, especially the Netbook UX, about the lack of info on the Netbook UX. Each one of them said the same thing ‚Äì MeeGo is putting the Netbook UX into Maintanence Mode, stopping any further development on it, and only providing bug fixes for major issues.¬† I asked if there was going to be any announcement, basically the answer was nothing official. They‚Äôre just going to let it drift away ‚Äì just like netbooks themselves have.

 [2]: http://wiki.meego.com/Release_Engineering/Plans/1.2 "MeeGo Release Engineering Pans for 1.2"

There are most likely a huge number of reasons, which is fair enough. I was given a couple of reasons ‚Äì 1: Netbooks arent selling anymore, the Netbook ship didn‚Äôt really sail away, but was sunk. 2: MeeGo doesn‚Äôt want to invest anymore time or effort in gtk development, and wants to concentrate on Qt. Now I take this last one with a tiny bit of salt, only because both Intel and Nokia employ (or at least did so) a sizable team of GNOME developers. Saying that though, if they want to keep a roof over their heads they have to do what their employer says, and both originally started working with touch devices. So it does make sense as much as it doesn‚Äôt.

So, I herby give immediate notice that I am now no longer going to be doing any further work on the MeeGo UX for openSUSE or anyone else.¬† I wont delete the repo for 1.0 but will clear out the 1.1 and 1.2 repos that I had ‚Äì might as well give those resources back :-) Now if anyone would like to continue what I and others had started, then let me know and I would be more than happy.

I cant say what the other distros are going to do, I‚Äôve spoken to my counter part in Fedora, and they‚Äôre having a think about it as they were busting their chops to get things in for the F15 release.¬† Either way I wish all involved luck.

Now before any of you conspiracy theory junkies get worked up ‚Äì this has nothing to do with the whole MeeGo Trademark issue that Smeegol had with the Linux Foundation.¬† As it happens I was due to have a conversation with the Linux Foundation about the issues between us and them, but have had to re-schedule due to travel constraints from one party or the other.¬† I still intend to speak with the LF about the issues, as they are still present in the other UX‚Äôs that they are developing.

So it‚Äôs time for me to close off and say, so long and thanks for all the fish! I‚Äôll still be around, I‚Äôll probably start getting back into the GNOME swing of things, and help fcrozat with GNOME3 etc.¬† Oh and I‚Äôve got a lunatic idea for a project which I intend to kick off (stay tuned ;-) ).

[MeeGo is a trademark of the Linux Foundation][5].

No, I‚Äôm not talking about [this board][1] ‚Äì I‚Äôm talking about the cool project by GNOME afficianado [Lucas Rocha][2] ‚Äì [The Board][3].

 [2]: http://lucasr.org/ "Lucas Rocha's Blog"
 [3]: http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject "The Board's website"

There is a little gotcha with the packages ‚Äì it is for openSUSE Factory/11.4 only at the moment. I need to work on backporting some of the shiny dependencies to 11.3.

Things aren‚Äôt 100%, as I need to do a tiny bit of cleaning up with the packages, but it works pretty well for a 0.1.0 release ;-)

If you want to grab it then just head on over and click the magic button [![1Click for the-board][5]][6]

      <p>Bugging Bugs - A Call For&nbsp;Help</p>
    </div>

    <p>Personally I find that in Linux or any <span class="caps">OS</span> for that matter, keeping track of and dealing with bugs can be a real <span class="caps">PITA.</span>¬† This may be in part that I‚Äôm not a power user of the services available (they don‚Äôt make it obvious how to fully utilise their service); also there are so many different types of bug trackers out there ‚Äì bugzilla, trac, mantis, etc; it is also down to so many different projects use their own tracker; one advantage is that code/project hosting sites have their own ‚Äì SourceForge, Gna!, launchpad, Berli<span class="caps">OS</span>, etc.¬† So all projects under these use the same tool/interface.¬† Yes bugzilla is probably the most common, but it is also one of the most modified ‚Äì no two projects using it are the same and the work flow differs as much as the&nbsp;visuals.</p>

<p>As an illustration, I am active or have a keen interest in open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Bongo.¬† One uses a customised version of Bugzilla and the other uses <span class="caps">GNA</span>!‚Äôs Savane.¬† As a result, I am also in contact with a multitude of other projects (<span class="caps">GNOME</span>, <span class="caps">KDE</span>, Freedesktop.org, Moblin, Gwibber to name a few).¬† These all have their own bug trackers on different services, so to add them to the original two means I have at least seven different tracking services to deal with.¬† My dealings range from filing bugs, to monitoring a bug for information and even the odd occaison where I am assigned a bug to&nbsp;resolve.</p>

<p>Now I know they all pump out emails when something changes to the bug, but having to hunt through my email to get bug ids or whatever is annoying to say the least, not to mention filling up my inbox.¬† One big gripe is with people adding themselves to the <span class="caps">CC</span> list; do I really care if Chief Umbuzweiluh has added himself to the <span class="caps">CC</span> list for a particular bug?&nbsp;No!</p>

<p>Now what I would like&nbsp;is:</p>

<ul>
<li>  An application that can either sit on my desktop or in the notification panel that can help me manage all my&nbsp;bugs.</li>
<li>  The app would need to be cross desktop friendly, so that it doesn‚Äôt look out of place on whichever <span class="caps">DE</span> I‚Äôm using ‚Äì yes I do use more than one&nbsp;:-) </li>
<li>  Ideally offer some form of offline functionality ‚Äì caching/storing the information&nbsp;locally.</li>
<li>  I don‚Äôt care what language it is written in, something that anyone can understand would be handy, heck I may even contribute some code if it is easy enough&nbsp;;-)</li>
<li>  Support multiple backends, as I said I use lots of different trackers so getting the bulk of them supported would be&nbsp;ideal.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I mention ‚Äúoffline‚Äù I would ideally like to have read write access so that I can then update a bug say if I‚Äôm on the move and then the app syncs with the backend next time I‚Äôm online.¬† I appreciate this may be harder to implement so I‚Äôd be happy with read only access.¬† Basically the sort of information I‚Äôd like to see is something along the lines&nbsp;of:</p>

<p>|Tracker(1)|Bug<span class="caps">ID</span>(2)|Summary(3)|Status(4)|Role(5)|Product(6)Priority(7)|Severity(8)|&nbsp;(9)|-(10)|</p>

<ol>
<li> Which bug tracker is it on ‚Äì Novell, <span class="caps">GNOME</span>, Launchpad, <span class="caps">KDE</span>, etc. Ideally show the logo of the tracker but if not a short text ‚Äì <span class="caps">BNC</span>, <span class="caps">BGO</span>, <span class="caps">LP</span>, <span class="caps">BKO</span>,&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li> The bug number, ideally as a hyperlink so that it can be pasted into and email or <span class="caps">IM</span>&nbsp;conversation.</li>
<li> The bug summary. Basically whatever is put into the summary field of the&nbsp;bug.</li>
<li> The status of the bug ‚Äì New, Assigned, Re-Opened, Unconfirmed, NeedInfo,&nbsp;Closed.</li>
<li> What is your role with the bug ‚Äì Reporter, Asignee,&nbsp;<span class="caps">CC.</span></li>
<li> What product is the bug&nbsp;against.</li>
<li> What is the bug‚Äôs priority ‚Äì Urgent, High, Normal,&nbsp;Low.</li>
<li> What is the bug‚Äôs severuty ‚Äì Critical, Major, Normal, Minor,&nbsp;Trivial</li>
<li> Add a bug by either <span class="caps">ID</span> or url.¬† In an ideal world one would even be able to generate the whole thing from scratch and when you add it it create the ticket on the service and fills in the bug id for&nbsp;you.</li>
<li>Remove a bug. If one is on the <span class="caps">CC</span> list it would unsubscribe you from&nbsp;it.</li>
</ol>

<p>As I‚Äôm no code monkey I have no real idea on¬†<strong>how</strong>¬†to implement my idea, but what I do know is¬†<strong>what</strong>¬†I would like.¬† I would be more than happy for an app that just provided the above mentioned table, but in an ideal world the app would also provide the full conversation of the bug showing all comments and any attachments.¬† Baby steps first, get the basic information available then add features as things&nbsp;progress.</p>

<p>Now I would love for the app to do the notifying of bug changes for me so I can disable all the email notifications I get.¬† So having some form of notification area presence would be great, and even providing a bubble when something does&nbsp;change:</p>

<p>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî </p>

<p>| N / <span class="caps">BNC</span>(1)|12345(2)|Foo Bar Noob(3)&nbsp;| </p>

<p>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî</p>

<ol>
<li> Logo or <span class="caps">ID</span> of bug&nbsp;tracker</li>
<li> Bug <span class="caps">ID</span> ‚Äì&nbsp;clickable</li>
<li> What has changed ‚Äì this could be Status, Role, Product, Priority,&nbsp;Severity</li>
</ol>

<p>Now depending on how the app works will depend on what happens when one clicks on the bug id. Is there functionality for full context (fat app) or will it just open up in a browser.¬† The intial services I would like to see are (in priority) ‚Äì Bugzilla, Savane, Launchpad, Trac, Sourceforge, and then anyting&nbsp;else.</p>

<p>So does anyone fancy being my hero and coding this for me?¬† It would be great if we could get this as part of GSoC ‚Äì I‚Äôll add it to openFate and the wiki&nbsp;;-)</p>

<p>If anyone knows of something that exists that provides this functionality please let me know.¬† Chris Lamb did create a <span class="caps">GNOME</span> Applet for the Debian <span class="caps">BTS</span> tracker that kind of did this so if it helps have a look¬†<a href="http://chris-lamb.co.uk/projects/debian-bts-applet/" title="Lamby's BTS Applet">here</a>¬†for the&nbsp;code.</p>

<li> The bug number, ideally as a hyperlink so that it can be pasted into and email or IM conversation.</li>
<li> The bug summary. Basically whatever is put into the summary field of the bug.</li>
<li> The status of the bug ‚Äì New, Assigned, Re-Opened, Unconfirmed, NeedInfo, Closed.</li>
<li> What is your role with the bug ‚Äì Reporter, Asignee, CC.</li>
<li> What product is the bug against.</li>
<li> What is the bug‚Äôs priority ‚Äì Urgent, High, Normal, Low.</li>
<li> What is the bug‚Äôs severuty ‚Äì Critical, Major, Normal, Minor, Trivial</li>
<li> Add a bug by either ID or url.¬† In an ideal world one would even be able to generate the whole thing from scratch and when you add it it create the ticket on the service and fills in the bug id for you.</li>
<li>Remove a bug. If one is on the CC list it would unsubscribe you from it.</li>
</ol>

<p>As I‚Äôm no code monkey I have no real idea on¬†<strong>how</strong>¬†to implement my idea, but what I do know is¬†<strong>what</strong>¬†I would like.¬† I would be more than happy for an app that just provided the above mentioned table, but in an ideal world the app would also provide the full conversation of the bug showing all comments and any attachments.¬† Baby steps first, get the basic information available then add features as things progress.</p>

<p>Now I would love for the app to do the notifying of bug changes for me so I can disable all the email notifications I get.¬† So having some form of notification area presence would be great, and even providing a bubble when something does change:</p>

<p>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî </p>

<p>| N / BNC(1)|12345(2)|Foo Bar Noob(3) | </p>

<p>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî</p>

<ol>
<li> Logo or ID of bug tracker</li>
<li> Bug ID ‚Äì clickable</li>
<li> What has changed ‚Äì this could be Status, Role, Product, Priority, Severity</li>
</ol>

<p>Now depending on how the app works will depend on what happens when one clicks on the bug id. Is there functionality for full context (fat app) or will it just open up in a browser.¬† The intial services I would like to see are (in priority) ‚Äì Bugzilla, Savane, Launchpad, Trac, Sourceforge, and then anyting else.</p>

<p>So does anyone fancy being my hero and coding this for me?¬† It would be great if we could get this as part of GSoC ‚Äì I‚Äôll add it to openFate and the wiki ;-)</p>

<p>If anyone knows of something that exists that provides this functionality please let me know.¬† Chris Lamb did create a GNOME Applet for the Debian BTS tracker that kind of did this so if it helps have a look¬†<a href="http://chris-lamb.co.uk/projects/debian-bts-applet/" title="Lamby's BTS Applet">here</a>¬†for the code.</p>

    <p>I was asked the other day ‚ÄúWhat do you expect from the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Conference?‚Äù The simple answer is I only expect to have fun. Seriously, I expect nothing more, nothing less. I hope for a whole lot more, but I certainly don‚Äôt expect&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>This may sound somewhat silly, but in all honesty that‚Äôs how I feel.

<p>So if I take the original question and rephrase it to ‚ÄúWhat do you hope for from the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Conference?‚Äù then my answer at least for this year would be something along these&nbsp;lines:</p>

      <p>open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> on the Series 3 Chromebook - Quick and&nbsp;Easy</p>
    </div>

    <p>I have blogged about how to get <a href="http://blogs.arm.com/software-enablement/848-running-linux-on-the-series-3-chromebook/" title="Manual process to get Linux on the Chromebook">Linux on the Chromebook</a> in the past; and whilst the process works, it isn‚Äôt the easiest or most friendly way. Thanks to the tireless work of the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> <span class="caps">ARM</span> Team (especially Alex Graf and¬†Marcus Sch√§fer) we now have a simpler way to get open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> on the Chromebook. ¬†We now have an installable image that can be dd‚Äôed directly to either an <span class="caps">SD</span> card or <span class="caps">USB</span> drive (I‚Äôve not tried the internal e<span class="caps">MMC</span>) just like any other <span class="caps">ARM</span> device. To get the goodies check out the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:ARMChromebook" title="Series 3 Chromebook on openSUSE's Wiki">Chromebook wiki page</a>. This process has numerous advantages to the manual process, chief amongst them is easy updating of the Kernel and painless deployment of the image. There are various things that need fixing still, but they are being worked on and will happen&nbsp;soon(ish).</p>

<p>If you have a Chromebook, please try it out and let us know how things work or don‚Äôt for you on <span class="caps">IRC</span> #opensuse-arm on Freenode and/or the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/" title="openSUSE Mailing List Archive">opensuse-arm</a> mailing list . Please take note of the known issues on the wiki page before shouting&nbsp;;-) </p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong>
Some people asked about card/stick size to use. If you want to just use the Je<span class="caps">OS</span> image which is command line only, then the minimum size is <span class="caps">1GB</span>, if however you wish to use the <span class="caps">XFCE</span> image or use Je<span class="caps">OS</span> and then install a <span class="caps">DE</span> on top then the real minimum would be <span class="caps">4GB.</span> Thanks to Kiwi, the images are self extracting. This means that when you complete the first boot process it will use up all the space on your target media, so 4/8/16/32/64/<span class="caps">128GB</span> depending on what you&nbsp;have.</p>

I have blogged about how to get [Linux on the Chromebook][1] in the past; and whilst the process works, it isn‚Äôt the easiest or most friendly way. Thanks to the tireless work of the openSUSE ARM Team (especially Alex Graf and¬†Marcus Sch√§fer) we now have a simpler way to get openSUSE on the Chromebook. ¬†We now have an installable image that can be dd‚Äôed directly to either an SD card or USB drive (I‚Äôve not tried the internal eMMC) just like any other ARM device. To get the goodies check out the [Chromebook wiki page][2]. This process has numerous advantages to the manual process, chief amongst them is easy updating of the Kernel and painless deployment of the image. There are various things that need fixing still, but they are being worked on and will happen soon(ish).

If you have a Chromebook, please try it out and let us know how things work or don‚Äôt for you on IRC #opensuse-arm on Freenode and/or the [opensuse-arm][3] mailing list . Please take note of the known issues on the wiki page before shouting ;-)

**UPDATE**
Some people asked about card/stick size to use. If you want to just use the JeOS image which is command line only, then the minimum size is 1GB, if however you wish to use the XFCE image or use JeOS and then install a DE on top then the real minimum would be 4GB. Thanks to Kiwi, the images are self extracting. This means that when you complete the first boot process it will use up all the space on your target media, so 4/8/16/32/64/128GB depending on what you have.;T;

      <p>Disappointment at the Linux Foundation and MeeGo&nbsp;Project</p>
    </div>

    <p>I‚Äôve been stewing over a response on the MeeGo developers mailing list for some time now.¬† Basically the MeeGo Project and their steward, the Linux Foundation don‚Äôt seem to be wanting to play this whole open source, open community game.¬† I wouldn‚Äôt have any issue with it if it was just Nokia and Intel fumbling with MeeGo, it would be just another lost opportunity that big corporations screwed up on.¬† Problem is the Linux Foundation is involved and are supposedly the ones guiding the&nbsp;project.</p>

<p>In case you don‚Äôt know, before I released Smeegol I asked some questions on the MeeGo Dev list with regards to what open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> can/can‚Äôt do/use.¬† That kind of went nowhere.¬† Fedora have also tried asking and again got nowhere.¬†¬†<a href="http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-October/479228.html" title="Debian requesting info from MeeGo">Debian have also asked</a>, and after seven weeks the<a href="http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-December/480512.html" title="the LF's response to Debian">Linux Foundation answered</a>.</p>

<p>In all honesty, I was insensed by the response. I spoke to my counterparts at Fedora and they too echoed my feelings. To allow those in the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> and wider community who aren‚Äôt subscribed to the MeeGo lists I‚Äôll provide my response.¬† For those in a&nbsp;rush:</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>¬†- Don‚Äôt think MeeGo, don‚Äôt say MeeGo, don‚Äôt contribute to MeeGo unless it is on our terms, don‚Äôt use MeeGo unless it is on our crippled distro, MeeGo is going it&nbsp;alone.</p>

<p>For those that want to see me rant some&nbsp;more:</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Ibrahim,</p>

<p>On Thu, 2010-12-09 at 13:12 -0600, Ibrahim Haddad wrote:<br>
&gt; Hello Didier,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am responding to you in relation to your inquiry below. First,<br>
&gt; thanks very much for sending the MeeGo Project these questions. We<br>
&gt; really do appreciate it. The MeeGo Project members devoted quite a bit<br>
&gt; of time discussing these questions to make sure the¬† responses are<br>
&gt; fair and most of all work to the benefit of the MeeGo project, its<br>
&gt; developers and the users of MeeGo.<br>
&gt;</p>

<p>Seven weeks to effectively turn around and say ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äù?¬† I‚Äôm sorry<br>
if I sound bitter or angry; but the truth of the matter is that I‚Äôm<br>
actually fairly disgusted with how the Linux Foundation, Nokia and Intel<br>
have all acted towards the wider Linux community.¬† For all the talk of<br>
openness at the conference in Dublin all I see are closed doors and<br>
barricades.</p>

<p>&gt;<br>
&gt; To start with, the goal is to avoid any confusion around what is and<br>
&gt; what is not MeeGo.¬† Anything that is or will become associated with<br>
&gt; the MeeGo trademark has to be in conformance with the compliance<br>
&gt; program.¬† With that in mind, it becomes clear why none of the proposed<br>
&gt; uses of MeeGo¬† mentioned in your email are in line with the trademark<br>
&gt; policy and guidelines as they create confusion around MeeGo project<br>
&gt; packages, mailing list, project team name, etc.¬† For example, when you<br>
&gt; append MeeGo to a package name, it would be very reasonable to<br>
&gt; conclude that this is an official MeeGo package coming from MeeGo.com,<br>
&gt; which is not the case and could cause confusion both for your users as<br>
&gt; well MeeGo‚Äôs.<br>
&gt;</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sorry but do you honestly think that users who install the MeeGo <span class="caps">UX</span><br>
on a distro be it open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>, Fedora, Debian or whichever are going to<br>
think that it has come from the MeeGo project?¬† This doesn‚Äôt happen for<br>
any open source project that is available via a distribution. <span class="caps">GNOME</span>, <span class="caps">KDE</span><br>
etc welcome inclusion into distros and want downstream involvement.¬† Why<br>
do you feel that MeeGo&nbsp;doesn‚Äôt?</p>

<p>Trying to paint all users with a stupid brush is wrong and condescending<br>
to both users and distros.¬† You appear to be missing a key factor that<br>
myself and my counterparts are doing here ‚Äì marketing MeeGo and enabling<br>
the wider community to get involved and help make MeeGo better.¬† Why<br>
should a developer have to install a new distro to be able to contribute<br>
to the&nbsp;codebase?</p>

<p>Having meego in a package name shows where the upstream contribution<br>
comes from.¬† Just like with packages from Google etc.¬† This is the most<br>
basic form of attribution, and is only right.¬† Why are you trying to<br>
force people to fork?¬† Yes, fork.¬† If you don‚Äôt want people to recognise<br>
your work and re-use it with almost no changes why have it in the&nbsp;open?</p>

<p>Linux users and especially developers can be fickle, they find a distro<br>
they like and stick to it ‚Äì quite often they are more faithful to their<br>
distro than they are to their partner or loved one.¬† Forcing them to<br>
choose between distro or contributing to MeeGo the chances are they‚Äôll<br>
stick to their distro of&nbsp;choice.</p>

<p>When Moblin was around, it was one of three things ‚Äì a User eXperience,<br>
a distribution and a reference platform.¬† This worked well, so why have<br>
you changed&nbsp;it?</p>

<p>/&gt;<br>
/&gt; We would ask you to move away from using {M,m}-e-e-{G,g}-o or any<br>
/&gt; subset of those letters or sounds in that order, alone or in<br>
/&gt; combination with other letters, words or marks that would tend to<br>
/&gt; cause someone to make a reasonable connection of the reference with<br>
/&gt; the MeeGo mark. We specifically discussed one possibility for<br>
/&gt; illustration purposes ‚Äì which is to use <span class="caps">MG</span> in the place of MeeGo.¬† We<br>
/&gt; do not think that a plain text <span class="caps">MG</span>, when used in reference to the code,<br>
/&gt; as in a file or project or team name, would cause a reasonable person<br>
/&gt; to be confused.<br>
/&gt;</p>

<p>This fanatical enforcement of the MeeGo trademark is going to do more<br>
damage than good.¬† People have asked me what‚Äôs different between MeeGo‚Äôs<br>
trademark guidelines and open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>‚Äôs, and the simple answer is it is the<br>
execution of the trademark that sets us apart.¬† Thinking that people are<br>
going to get ‚Äúconfused‚Äù between Smeegol and MeeGo is ludicrous.¬† Sure<br>
I‚Äôm not a lawyer/solicitor or any other form of legal professional, but<br>
I don‚Äôt need to be to apply common&nbsp;sense.</p>

<p>We are trying to promote MeeGo and further it in an already crowded<br>
space.¬† Making us change package names, and removing any reference to<br>
MeeGo gives you absolutely zero visibility.¬† At the end of the day,<br>
open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> and the other distros have a much wider reach than MeeGo does,<br>
and possibly ever will as a stand alone&nbsp;distro.</p>

<p>/&gt;<br>
/&gt; We are available for additional discussions if needed and if you<br>
/&gt; prefer to have a call to discuss we can certainly do that.<br>
/&gt;</p>

<p>I have tried several times to discuss these issues, and have even tried<br>
going off list to facilitate the dialogue in a more protected manner.<br>
MeeGo is far from open to the community, if I was an <span class="caps">ISV</span> or <span class="caps">ISV</span> then<br>
sure it maybe more open but from what I‚Äôve heard even partners have a<br>
tough&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>Being an exclusive project is a sure way to failure. Try being<br>
inclusive, you‚Äôll have more chance of succeeding.¬† If you don‚Äôt want<br>
community participation that‚Äôs fine, re-license to something proprietary<br>
and you wont get bothered by those that want to help.¬† Yes you have<br>
already re-licensed some code from open licenses to proprietary ones<br>
without any announcement to the community, not a great open&nbsp;gesture.</p>

<p>/&gt;<br>

I‚Äôve been stewing over a response on the MeeGo developers mailing list for some time now.¬† Basically the MeeGo Project and their steward, the Linux Foundation don‚Äôt seem to be wanting to play this whole open source, open community game.¬† I wouldn‚Äôt have any issue with it if it was just Nokia and Intel fumbling with MeeGo, it would be just another lost opportunity that big corporations screwed up on.¬† Problem is the Linux Foundation is involved and are supposedly the ones guiding the project.

In case you don‚Äôt know, before I released Smeegol I asked some questions on the MeeGo Dev list with regards to what openSUSE can/can‚Äôt do/use.¬† That kind of went nowhere.¬† Fedora have also tried asking and again got nowhere.¬†¬†[Debian have also asked][1], and after seven weeks the[Linux Foundation answered][2].

 [1]: http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-October/479228.html "Debian requesting info from MeeGo"
 [2]: http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-December/480512.html "the LF's response to Debian"

In all honesty, I was insensed by the response. I spoke to my counterparts at Fedora and they too echoed my feelings. To allow those in the openSUSE and wider community who aren‚Äôt subscribed to the MeeGo lists I‚Äôll provide my response.¬† For those in a rush:

**tl;dr**¬†- Don‚Äôt think MeeGo, don‚Äôt say MeeGo, don‚Äôt contribute to MeeGo unless it is on our terms, don‚Äôt use MeeGo unless it is on our crippled distro, MeeGo is going it alone.

For those that want to see me rant some more:

    <p>Enterprise in the&nbsp;Community</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that the Geeko is somewhat of a schizophrenic at times, and do you know what I kind of have to agree.¬† The difference is I disagree on how the schizophrenia affects our dear friend.¬† Most people think that the multiple personalities are desktop related¬† ‚Äì you know, <span class="caps">KDE</span> vs <span class="caps">GNOME</span> vs <span class="caps">XFCE</span> vs $<span class="caps">DE.</span>¬† I on the other hand feel it is to with audience ‚Äì Enterprise vs Consumer.¬† Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, the Geeko does a great job at both.¬† The problem is there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a great deal of interaction between the two&nbsp;personalities.</p>

<p>Yes, some features from the enterprise product feed into the consumer product and vice versa which is lovely and vital.¬† What is missing is community interaction.¬† As it stands I see very little evidence of <span class="caps">SLE</span> customers interacting with the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community, and to an extent <span class="caps">SLE</span> is somewhat shunned as the illegitimate love child by many within the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community ‚Äì which is just plain wrong!¬† There are times when <span class="caps">SLE</span> deadlines get on my nerves, but that is no reason to shun the staff working on it or disrespect the&nbsp;product.</p>

<p>In my job working for a major systems provider and integrator in the <span class="caps">UK</span>, we use a lot of <span class="caps">SLE</span> and others including Red Hat, <span class="caps">AIX</span>, Solaris and <span class="caps">HP</span>-<span class="caps">UX.</span>¬† The one thing that is constant is we don‚Äôt interact with the communities of the OSes, unless it is via the Sales/Support departments.¬† Now it might be because of time constraints, but I‚Äôm not convinced.¬† I haven‚Äôt seen any ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù interact with the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community other than maybe with the Build Service.¬† Which is a real shame, as there are some great customers of the <span class="caps">SLE</span> product and some great people employed by&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>So how do our peers deal with it? To be honest I have no idea :-) I can only guess that they encounter the same issue, well potentially Red Hat <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Fedora.¬† Ubuntu on the other hand have somewhat of an advantage, in so much as their enterprise product isn‚Äôt a separate product but in fact part of the standard release.¬† So when it comes to getting ISVs, partners and customers involved they can safely say that *all* Ubuntu users can benefit from it ‚Äì not just the enterprise customers.¬† This is a crucial point, as more people are likely to use the distro and play with it and then sign the big fat cheque for the support.¬† By that time they have already got involved with the community and will most likely continue to do&nbsp;so.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not trying to tell Novell that they need to change their business model, all what I‚Äôm saying is we need Novell‚Äôs help to engage their customers and partners to be part of <span class="caps">OUR</span> community ‚Äì <span class="caps">N.B</span> Our Community == open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> *&amp;* <span class="caps">SLE.</span>¬† At the end of the day it‚Äôs a win/win situation for all parties ‚Äì they can then get maximum exposure, an element of testing of their product without having to start from scratch to get things certified etc. We benefit from a bigger community thanks to their involvement, and have many more cool things to use/play with ![:-)][1] ¬†¬† A key one here is that of ISVs, there are a shed load of ISVs that are certified against <span class="caps">SLE</span> ‚Äì iirc somewhere in the region of 5000 apps.¬† That‚Äôs an impressive number, but unfortunately open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> sees bupkiss! Absolutely nada, niet, nil points, zilch :-(  Looking at Ubuntu they apparently have a fraction of that amount ‚Äì somehere in the region of 200 or so.¬† The big difference is that almost *all* Ubunteros can use or access those apps.¬† The same goes for IHVs ‚Äì hardware is only certified against <span class="caps">SLE</span> products which is great, but open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> doesn‚Äôt get a look in.¬† There are some vendors that sell their kit with open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> pre-installed but there isn‚Äôt the same sort of love coming from the mothership for them which really could do with&nbsp;changing.</p>

<p>Looks like I digressed somewhat ‚Äì sorry.¬† So getting back on track(ish) how many of you guys and gals use <span class="caps">SLE</span> professionally?¬† It could be either <span class="caps">SLES</span> or <span class="caps">SLED.</span>¬† If you do use a <span class="caps">SLE</span> product do you partake in the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community professionally or is it purely part of your undying love for the Geeko? If you don‚Äôt is there a particular reason why not, anything blocking you joining in, or do you just choose not to?¬† If you do participate as part of your job, what issues do you encounter, what could be improved&nbsp;etc?</p>

<p>As always I would love to hear from you if you have anything to discuss on the topic of Enterprise in the Community. Remember this is for your benefit as part of the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community. So please join in and get&nbsp;discussing.</p>

Enterprise in the Community

It has been mentioned that the Geeko is somewhat of a schizophrenic at times, and do you know what I kind of have to agree.¬† The difference is I disagree on how the schizophrenia affects our dear friend.¬† Most people think that the multiple personalities are desktop related¬† ‚Äì you know, KDE vs GNOME vs XFCE vs $DE.¬† I on the other hand feel it is to with audience ‚Äì Enterprise vs Consumer.¬† Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, the Geeko does a great job at both.¬† The problem is there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a great deal of interaction between the two personalities.

Yes, some features from the enterprise product feed into the consumer product and vice versa which is lovely and vital.¬† What is missing is community interaction.¬† As it stands I see very little evidence of SLE customers interacting with the openSUSE community, and to an extent SLE is somewhat shunned as the illegitimate love child by many within the openSUSE community ‚Äì which is just plain wrong!¬† There are times when SLE deadlines get on my nerves, but that is no reason to shun the staff working on it or disrespect the product.

In my job working for a major systems provider and integrator in the UK, we use a lot of SLE and others including Red Hat, AIX, Solaris and HP-UX.¬† The one thing that is constant is we don‚Äôt interact with the communities of the OSes, unless it is via the Sales/Support departments.¬† Now it might be because of time constraints, but I‚Äôm not convinced.¬† I haven‚Äôt seen any ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù interact with the openSUSE community other than maybe with the Build Service.¬† Which is a real shame, as there are some great customers of the SLE product and some great people employed by them.

So how do our peers deal with it? To be honest I have no idea :-) I can only guess that they encounter the same issue, well potentially Red Hat & Fedora.¬† Ubuntu on the other hand have somewhat of an advantage, in so much as their enterprise product isn‚Äôt a separate product but in fact part of the standard release.¬† So when it comes to getting ISVs, partners and customers involved they can safely say that \*all\* Ubuntu users can benefit from it ‚Äì not just the enterprise customers.¬† This is a crucial point, as more people are likely to use the distro and play with it and then sign the big fat cheque for the support.¬† By that time they have already got involved with the community and will most likely continue to do so.

I‚Äôm not trying to tell Novell that they need to change their business model, all what I‚Äôm saying is we need Novell‚Äôs help to engage their customers and partners to be part of OUR community ‚Äì N.B Our Community == openSUSE \*&\* SLE.¬† At the end of the day it‚Äôs a win/win situation for all parties ‚Äì they can then get maximum exposure, an element of testing of their product without having to start from scratch to get things certified etc. We benefit from a bigger community thanks to their involvement, and have many more cool things to use/play with ![:-)][1] ¬†¬† A key one here is that of ISVs, there are a shed load of ISVs that are certified against SLE ‚Äì iirc somewhere in the region of 5000 apps.¬† That‚Äôs an impressive number, but unfortunately openSUSE sees bupkiss! Absolutely nada, niet, nil points, zilch :-(  Looking at Ubuntu they apparently have a fraction of that amount ‚Äì somehere in the region of 200 or so.¬† The big difference is that almost \*all\* Ubunteros can use or access those apps.¬† The same goes for IHVs ‚Äì hardware is only certified against SLE products which is great, but openSUSE doesn‚Äôt get a look in.¬† There are some vendors that sell their kit with openSUSE pre-installed but there isn‚Äôt the same sort of love coming from the mothership for them which really could do with changing.

Looks like I digressed somewhat ‚Äì sorry.¬† So getting back on track(ish) how many of you guys and gals use SLE professionally?¬† It could be either SLES or SLED.¬† If you do use a SLE product do you partake in the openSUSE community professionally or is it purely part of your undying love for the Geeko? If you don‚Äôt is there a particular reason why not, anything blocking you joining in, or do you just choose not to?¬† If you do participate as part of your job, what issues do you encounter, what could be improved etc?

As always I would love to hear from you if you have anything to discuss on the topic of Enterprise in the Community. Remember this is for your benefit as part of the openSUSE community. So please join in and get discussing.;T;

    <div class="title">
      <p>Planning For The&nbsp;Future</p>
    </div>

    <p>It‚Äôs been over a week now since I came back from the fantabulous <span class="caps">FOSDEM</span>, and have had a chance to digest a lot of the conversations I had whilst there. One of the conversations I had was with a senior developer who was in a sort of Special Interest Group. He mentioned to me that his management had asked the <span class="caps">SIG</span> to formulate a plan for where they wanted to see their project in five years, and how they aimed to get&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>Now I thought about that idea for a while, and to be honest I find it a¬†<strong>really</strong>¬†difficult question to answer properly. So I thought I‚Äôd ask my fellow community members (whether that‚Äôs open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>, Bongo or whatever) how would you answer that question in relation to your chosen project? I can invariably only come up with a partial answer, not a full where and how. Let me try and show you what I&nbsp;mean.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll take¬†<a href="http://bongo-project.org/" title="The Bongo Project - simple e-mail &amp; calendaring">Bongo</a>¬†as my first example. For those that have no idea what Bongo is let me explain: Bongo is an evolution of some forward thinking by some people who used to work at Novell. It started out as the Hula Project; then Novell sold the related assets off due to strategy alignments (or whatever); a few of us wanted to continue and forked the code and created the Bongo Project. <span class="caps">OK</span> so that‚Äôs a brief history but what is it? Bongo is a lightweight and simple e-mail <span class="amp">&amp;</span> calendaring solution, it is based on proven technology ‚Äì the heritage goes back to <span class="caps">NIMS</span> if I‚Äôm not mistaken. Whoopee do there are like a million and one e-mail solutions out there. Yes but not all in one solutions that are light on resources and contain all functions. Bongo is <span class="caps">NOT</span> a groupware product, it is aimed at SMBs, geeks education and pretty much anyone that just wants e-mail, calendaring and contacts. Think of it as a <span class="caps">FOSS</span> solution to provide the functionality of Gmail Google Calendar. Here endeth the history&nbsp;lesson.</p>

<p>Back to the example. So I need to list where I would like to see Bongo in five years time, <span class="caps">OK</span> how&nbsp;about:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Used by a large number of education and&nbsp;SMBs</li>
<li>  Shipped with all the major&nbsp;distributions</li>
<li>  Mimicked but never beaten by potential&nbsp;competitors</li>
<li>  Partnering with other projects to maximise&nbsp;reach</li>
<li>  Leading edge web front&nbsp;end</li>
<li>  Hooks for multiple&nbsp;languages/frameworks</li>
<li>  Large developer&nbsp;community</li>
<li>  Large user&nbsp;community</li>
<li>  Global&nbsp;domination</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the trickier part ‚Äì how to achieve those goals. So far all I can come up with is (in no particular&nbsp;order):</p>

<ul>
<li>  Canvas more developers that are interested in the e-mail/calendaring space to join&nbsp;in</li>
<li>  Advertise and market&nbsp;Bongo</li>
<li>  Actually get a working Web<span class="caps">UI</span>&nbsp;done</li>
<li>  Look at existing solutions and try and learn from&nbsp;them</li>
<li>  Speak to distributions and see if they can&nbsp;help</li>
<li>  Win the&nbsp;lottery</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see the list for where is larger than the list for how. Sure I could expand the latter a bit by being more detailed but this is supposed to be a bullet list with summaries not an essay. In my view one needs to get a list to work from and then expand on it, maybe even categorising the bullet points to see what/how/where/when and also explaining&nbsp;why.</p>

<p>Now Bongo is a relatively simple project with a small user base and community, and a very defined focus. The other project that I‚Äôm involved in and care for is open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>, and lord knows that is no simple beast&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>Let me try the same with¬†<a href="http://www.opensuse.org/" title="The openSUSE Project - home of the Geeko">open<span class="caps">SUSE</span></a>. The&nbsp;where:</p>

<ul>
<li>  At the forefront of&nbsp;distributions</li>
<li>  Large developer&nbsp;base</li>
<li>  Better toolsets for&nbsp;developers</li>
<li>  Working better and closer with fellow&nbsp;distributions</li>
<li>  Have a foundation that manages the&nbsp;project</li>
<li>  Get more community contributors involved to lessen the load on&nbsp;Novellians</li>
<li>  Learn from other projects to help improve&nbsp;us</li>
<li>  Keep momentum&nbsp;going</li>
<li>  Grow the user&nbsp;base</li>
<li>  World&nbsp;domination</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the&nbsp;how:</p>

<ul>
<li>  More active&nbsp;marketing</li>
<li>  Speaking to developers of different projects to find ut what they feel is&nbsp;missing</li>
<li>  Win the&nbsp;lottery</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see I‚Äôm woefully short on how on earth I am to achieve anything.¬† I‚Äôm open to suggestions&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>I know for a fact that there may be one or two items that I‚Äôve listed that could be contentious, and do you know what? I sincerely hope so :-) Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really do appreciate and am grateful for all the work effort and money that Novell has invested in open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>; but it isn‚Äôt fair at all for Novell to keep carrying the Project. If anyone thinks they‚Äôre not, you are living in lala land. Sure some of it might be their own doing, but a lot isn‚Äôt and it is up to us the community help them so that we can benefit even&nbsp;more.</p>

<p>I really do hope people start thinking, and doing it seriously about where they would like to see their preferred project in five years time. I would also love to see people‚Äôs responses as to Where <span class="amp">&amp;</span> How they would do it. Anyone that starts screaming like my 21month old daughter about this or that will get a sound thrashing and ignored. There is absolutely¬†<strong><span class="caps">ZERO</span></strong>¬†room for pettiness in the community. If you disagree with something then great! Just make sure you are as detailed and as calm as possible about why and also how you propose to do it differently. This doesn‚Äôt just apply to this whole five year plan thing, but to general&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt loose your passion, just learn to use your passion&nbsp;;-)</p>

Back to the example. So I need to list where I would like to see Bongo in five years time, OK how about:

*   Used by a large number of education and SMBs
*   Shipped with all the major distributions
*   Mimicked but never beaten by potential competitors

Now Bongo is a relatively simple project with a small user base and community, and a very defined focus. The other project that I‚Äôm involved in and care for is openSUSE, and lord knows that is no simple beast :-)

Let me try the same with¬†[openSUSE][3]. The where:

*   At the forefront of distributions
*   Large developer base

*   Working better and closer with fellow distributions

*   Get more community contributors involved to lessen the load on Novellians
*   Learn from other projects to help improve us
*   Keep momentum going
*   Grow the user base
*   World domination

Now the how:

*   More active marketing
*   Speaking to developers of different projects to find ut what they feel is missing
*   Win the lottery

As you can see I‚Äôm woefully short on how on earth I am to achieve anything.¬† I‚Äôm open to suggestions :-)

</ul>

<p>As you can see I‚Äôm woefully short on how on earth I am to achieve anything.¬† I‚Äôm open to suggestions :-)</p>

<p>I know for a fact that there may be one or two items that I‚Äôve listed that could be contentious, and do you know what? I sincerely hope so :-) Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really do appreciate and am grateful for all the work effort and money that Novell has invested in openSUSE; but it isn‚Äôt fair at all for Novell to keep carrying the Project. If anyone thinks they‚Äôre not, you are living in lala land. Sure some of it might be their own doing, but a lot isn‚Äôt and it is up to us the community help them so that we can benefit even more.</p>

<p>I really do hope people start thinking, and doing it seriously about where they would like to see their preferred project in five years time. I would also love to see people‚Äôs responses as to Where &amp; How they would do it. Anyone that starts screaming like my 21month old daughter about this or that will get a sound thrashing and ignored. There is absolutely¬†<strong>ZERO</strong>¬†room for pettiness in the community. If you disagree with something then great! Just make sure you are as detailed and as calm as possible about why and also how you propose to do it differently. This doesn‚Äôt just apply to this whole five year plan thing, but to general discussion.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt loose your passion, just learn to use your passion ;-)</p>

    <p>Unfortunately one of the down sides to the 21st Century is that most people have either been directly affected by or know someone close that has been directly affected by cancer; this is a beast that takes many shapes and forms. The mortality rate for the disease is coming down slowly, but the fact is people still die from it. ¬†Unfortunately this is what happened to my mother-in-law last year&nbsp;:-(</p>

<p>Jane was a wonderful woman that was completely focused on family, she was a true matriarch. She was loved and adored not just by her immediate family but also by the large extended family, especially the children where she had an almost magical way. It was a great shock when she passed away, especially as she had fought off breast cancer in the winter of 2010 and had made a pretty god recovery even if she had to have a mastectomy. Unfortunately the cancer returned with a vengeance in the spring of 2011 and attacked her brain and her liver, the latter was especially bad. She lost her battle after after only a short few months and passed away in the summer of 2011 at the young age of 59. She left a husband, three children and seven grandchildren as well as being an aunt and surrogate grandparent to many many&nbsp;more.</p>

<p>Her husband, Chris, was looking forward to celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary in October of 2011, but¬†unfortunately¬†this was not to be. As a result he has taken the decision to do something in her memory and try an raise funds and awareness for cancer research and cures for this horrible disease. He will be embarking on a 5day trek in Peru going up to Maccu Pichu and back down again, which is fine if you‚Äôre a spritely 20 or 30 something, but Chris is 65 so his body isn‚Äôt as forgiving. It is with this that I kindly ask for your help in getting him to his ambitious goal. I appreciate that there are many charities asking for your help, and many others requesting donations of one form or anther; but please help Chris reach his&nbsp;goal.</p>

<p>Please donate whatever you can by heading over to his donations <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/Chris-Morffew" title="Please donate to Chris' effort">page</a>. With your help maybe we can find a way of helping more family members&nbsp;survive.</p>

      <p>Getting The Necessitas To Port To&nbsp;Android</p>
    </div>

    <p>So as I mentioned¬†<a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/03/04/bug-tracking-with-the-help-of-an-entomologist.html" title="Bug Tracking With The Help Of An Entomologist">earlier</a>¬†I managed to port¬†<a href="http://entimologist.sourceforge.net/" title="Entomologist Bug Tracking Client">entimologist</a>¬†to Android. This post will hopefully explain how I did&nbsp;this.</p>

<p>The shopping list for this task is relatively straight&nbsp;forward:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" title="Android Software Development Kit">Android&nbsp;<span class="caps">SDK</span></a></li>
<li>  <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html" title="Android Native Development Kit">Android&nbsp;<span class="caps">NDK</span></a></li>
<li>  Java development files (on open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> I use&nbsp;java-1_6_0-sun-devel)</li>
<li>  <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" title="Apache Ant">ant</a>¬†(on open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> ant is too old, I use the¬†<a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi" title="Grab the latest binary tarball">binary tarball</a>¬†from the Apache&nbsp;site)</li>
<li>  Qt Creator for Android <span class="caps">SDK</span> a.k.a¬†<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/necessitas/home/" title="Qt Creator for Android">Necessitas</a></li>
<li>  Not necessary but could be helpful ‚Äì¬†<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" title="Java IDE">Eclipse</a>¬†(on open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> don‚Äôt use the packages available as there are things missing that prevent building for android, use the¬†<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/heliossr2" title="Grab the binary tarball">binary tarball</a>¬†from the Eclipse&nbsp;site)</li>
<li>  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ministro.necessitas.p/files/" title="Qt libraries for Android">Ministro</a></li>
</ul>

<p>First thing I had done was install and setup Eclipse, I then setup the Android <span class="caps">SDK</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Android <span class="caps">NDK</span> ‚Äì that was done months ago. See the Android Developer site for good, clear&nbsp;instructions.</p>

<p>For setting up Necessitas, I used Alessandro‚Äôs¬†<a href="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/02/28/necessitas/" title="Clear instructions for Necessitas">post <span class="amp">&amp;</span> video</a>¬†as a guide, but there are also details on Necessitas‚Äô site. ¬†After following the steps, I couldnt quite get things working, and I was starting to think that <span class="caps">GNOME3</span> and Qt, were being children and bickering. No, they weren‚Äôt. It was me being a dufus! I hadn‚Äôt read the bit about ant needing to be &gt;=<span class="caps">1.8.0</span> :-) Download Ministro to somewhere safe (I popped mine in&nbsp;/opt/necessitas)</p>

<p>So to get things to work, I un-installed the ant rpm, extracted the bibnary tarball into ~/bin, and did&nbsp;a¬†<code>sudo ln -s ~/bin/apache-ant-1.8.2/bin/ant /usr/bin/ant</code></p>

<p>Now I wont pretend to know <span class="caps">WTF</span> I‚Äôm doing with Qt, as far as I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs another alien language. Problem is I needed to tell Necessitas what Qt libraries entomologist needed, I had no real idea. I had a look at the source and the spec file and got some clues, so I added the ones I thought were needed. I tried a build and got further than previously (now that I had the correct version of ant!). I was now getting some weird missing library error, but I couldn‚Äôt work it out. Along comes our new¬†<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Boosters_team" title="The Thirsty Thirteen">Boosters</a>¬†member¬†<a href="http://namtrac.org/" title="a.k.a cartman or divildivil">Ismail D√∂nmez</a>¬†to the rescue. ¬†There will be a lib$<span class="caps">APPNAME</span>.so that is created to work out which Qt libraries you need just do&nbsp;a¬†<code>readelf -d ¬†lib$APPNAME.so</code>.</p>

<p>In my case I did¬†<code>readelf -d libentomologist.so</code>¬†and&nbsp;got:</p>

<p><code>~/workspace/Entomologist-build-android&gt; readelf -d libentomologist.so</code></p>

<p>It may seem obvious, but look at the ones that have (<span class="caps">NEEDED</span>) in them ;-) I was missing libQtXml.so. Simply add the missing Qt library either by adding it manually in $PROJECT_<span class="caps">LOCATION</span> &gt; Other files &gt; android &gt; res &gt; values &gt; libs.xml, or simply tick the required one in Qt Creator by going to the Projects button on the left &gt; Run &gt; Package Configurations &gt; Libraries&nbsp;tab</p>

<p>When testing your app, make sure you select ‚ÄúInstall Ministro system wide qt shared libraries installer‚Äù from the Projects button on the left &gt; Run &gt; Deploy configurations, then select the .apk in the ‚ÄúChoose apk‚Äù&nbsp;button.</p>

<p>Once that‚Äôs done, hit the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button on the bottom left of Qt Creator and off you go :-) ¬†I appreciate it may seem like a lot of work, but honestly it isn‚Äôt that much. I buggered around for ages cursing, mainly because I hadn‚Äôt checked my version of ant and didnt read the error message being spat out. I also didn‚Äôt know about readelf -d. ¬†All I need to work out and try now is publishing to the Market https://market.android.com/. So all in all have fun and keep being¬†cute¬†Qt&nbsp;:-D</p>

First thing I had done was install and setup Eclipse, I then setup the Android SDK & Android NDK ‚Äì that was done months ago. See the Android Developer site for good, clear instructions.

For setting up Necessitas, I used Alessandro‚Äôs¬†[post & video][11]¬†as a guide, but there are also details on Necessitas‚Äô site. ¬†After following the steps, I couldnt quite get things working, and I was starting to think that GNOME3 and Qt, were being children and bickering. No, they weren‚Äôt. It was me being a dufus! I hadn‚Äôt read the bit about ant needing to be >=1.8.0 :-) Download Ministro to somewhere safe (I popped mine in /opt/necessitas)

 [11]: http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/02/28/necessitas/ "Clear instructions for Necessitas"

So to get things to work, I un-installed the ant rpm, extracted the bibnary tarball into ~/bin, and did a¬†`sudo ln -s ~/bin/apache-ant-1.8.2/bin/ant /usr/bin/ant`

Now I wont pretend to know WTF I‚Äôm doing with Qt, as far as I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs another alien language. Problem is I needed to tell Necessitas what Qt libraries entomologist needed, I had no real idea. I had a look at the source and the spec file and got some clues, so I added the ones I thought were needed. I tried a build and got further than previously (now that I had the correct version of ant!). I was now getting some weird missing library error, but I couldn‚Äôt work it out. Along comes our new¬†[Boosters][13]¬†member¬†[Ismail D√∂nmez][14]¬†to the rescue. ¬†There will be a lib$APPNAME.so that is created to work out which Qt libraries you need just do a¬†`readelf -d ¬†lib$APPNAME.so`.

In my case I did¬†`readelf -d libentomologist.so`¬†and got:

`~/workspace/Entomologist-build-android> readelf -d libentomologist.so`

It may seem obvious, but look at the ones that have (NEEDED) in them ;-) I was missing libQtXml.so. Simply add the missing Qt library either by adding it manually in $PROJECT_LOCATION > Other files > android > res > values > libs.xml, or simply tick the required one in Qt Creator by going to the Projects button on the left > Run > Package Configurations > Libraries tab

When testing your app, make sure you select ‚ÄúInstall Ministro system wide qt shared libraries installer‚Äù from the Projects button on the left > Run > Deploy configurations, then select the .apk in the ‚ÄúChoose apk‚Äù button.

Once that‚Äôs done, hit the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button on the bottom left of Qt Creator and off you go :-) ¬†I appreciate it may seem like a lot of work, but honestly it isn‚Äôt that much. I buggered around for ages cursing, mainly because I hadn‚Äôt checked my version of ant and didnt read the error message being spat out. I also didn‚Äôt know about readelf -d. ¬†All I need to work out and try now is publishing to the Market https://market.android.com/. So all in all have fun and keep being¬†cute¬†Qt :-D;T;
I"<p>So as I mentioned¬†<a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/03/04/bug-tracking-with-the-help-of-an-entomologist.html" title="Bug Tracking With The Help Of An Entomologist">earlier</a>¬†I managed to port¬†<a href="http://entimologist.sourceforge.net/" title="Entomologist Bug Tracking Client">entimologist</a>¬†to Android.

    </div>

    <p>Just a quick post to enlighten those that use an Intel <span class="caps">945GME</span> powered machine of a certain pixel limitation that you may not know&nbsp;about.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a full time user of the spiffy new <span class="caps">GNOME3</span> with the fancy gnome-shell mojo. As such it‚Äôs on my primary machine, which at the moment is an eee<span class="caps">PC</span> <span class="caps">1000HE.</span> Yup, that‚Äôs a netbook with a small 10‚Ä≥ screen and relatively low resolution of 1024√ó600 pixels. ¬†As I‚Äôm sat at my desk I thought I would use my 17‚Ä≥ Dell <span class="caps">LCD</span> monitor. So I plugged it in and selected ‚Äò<em>System Settings</em>&gt;<em>Displays</em>‚Äò Without any issue it saw my external monitor and allowed me to enable it. I chose not to mirror displays as I‚Äôd like to take advantage of the larger&nbsp;screen.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">POOF</span>!!</strong>¬†:-(</p>

<p>My <span class="caps">CPU</span> was getting spanked by gnome-shell, everything was grinding to a halt. I tried logging out and back in, but still my <span class="caps">CPU</span> was being pummeled. I tried rebooting, but that didn‚Äôt change the hammering that my poor Atom was&nbsp;getting.</p>

<p>I asked the resident crazy Frenchman, no not Vincent but his compatriot in crime, Frederic. He wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a bug or not, so advised to ask in #gnome-shell on&nbsp;<span class="caps">IRC.</span></p>

<p>Off I clicked to <span class="caps">IRC</span>, and pretty much as soon as I asked my question ‚Äì I had an answer from about three people; and they were all useful responses. Thankfully Emmanuelle gave me the clear&nbsp;answer:</p>

<p>The <span class="caps">945GME</span> can only push a maximum of 2048√ó2048 pixels, so my setup was just too many pixels for it ‚Äì 1024√ó600 1280√ó1024 = 2308√ó1624. Either I mirror my displays; lower the resolution on my external monitor; or disable the internal display (this is what I‚Äôve chosen for&nbsp;now).</p>

<p>So there you have it, the Intel <span class="caps">945GME</span> has a limit of 2048√ó2048 pixels. No maybes, ifs, or&nbsp;buts.</p>

<p>My CPU was getting spanked by gnome-shell, everything was grinding to a halt. I tried logging out and back in, but still my CPU was being pummeled. I tried rebooting, but that didn‚Äôt change the hammering that my poor Atom was getting.</p>

<p>I asked the resident crazy Frenchman, no not Vincent but his compatriot in crime, Frederic. He wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a bug or not, so advised to ask in #gnome-shell on IRC.</p>

<p>Off I clicked to IRC, and pretty much as soon as I asked my question ‚Äì I had an answer from about three people; and they were all useful responses. Thankfully Emmanuelle gave me the clear answer:</p>

<p>The 945GME can only push a maximum of 2048√ó2048 pixels, so my setup was just too many pixels for it ‚Äì 1024√ó600 1280√ó1024 = 2308√ó1624. Either I mirror my displays; lower the resolution on my external monitor; or disable the internal display (this is what I‚Äôve chosen for now).</p>

<p>So there you have it, the Intel 945GME has a limit of 2048√ó2048 pixels. No maybes, ifs, or buts.</p>

    <p>I like to think of myself as being fairly consistent, and I‚Äôve had one request for a long time, a desktop bug tracker client.

<p>No I‚Äôm not talking about your upper body appendages, but the architecture that powers most of your little devices (and some bigger ones too). Almost all smartphones, tablets and many other consumer devices are powered by <span class="caps">ARM</span> from one of the numerous&nbsp;licensees.</p>

<p>Didn‚Äôt open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> do something about this a while ago? Yes we did. Unfortunately the effort seems to have bitrotted somewhat, there were numerous reasons and I don‚Äôt even prophesise to know the all&nbsp;either.</p>

<p>As such I‚Äôm going to try and kickstart things, and see it through and hopefully see it grow. ¬†As I mentioned, this idea came up at the conference when I was talking to numerous people (I forget how it all started, but that doesn‚Äôt really matter). There was an overwhelmingly positive view on the matter, and that for me was all that counts. Now let me be crystal clear here, <em><span class="caps">THIS</span> <span class="caps">WILL</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">BE</span> A <span class="caps">ONE</span> <span class="caps">MAN</span> <span class="caps">SHOW</span>!!</em> I mentioned previously that my view is that we as a community are pretty lazy at times with getting our hands dirty. As such if you think things are going slow or not going in the direction you would like, don‚Äôt moan. Get your hands dirty and help make a&nbsp;difference.</p>

<p>The process will not be an easy one either, so don‚Äôt expect a port to magically appear over night. If we‚Äôre lucky we might be able to have a working port in 6 months. Maybe longer, maybe shorter; ultimately that lies with us as a&nbsp;community.</p>

<p>Stage one has begun already thanks to Adrian Schroeter, Alex Graf and Dirk Mueller. Stage one comprises of getting the boot strap process to work. At a cursory level this means getting the packages required for setting up a build chroot environment and for building these packages on the target <span class="caps">ARM</span> architecture. This will possibly take a fair amount of time, and no I won‚Äôt give any timelines for this ‚Äì how long is a piece of&nbsp;string?</p>

<p>open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> has a couple of advantages here, 1) we have the <span class="caps">OBS</span> which can cross build and if need be cross compile packages for numerous architectures (<span class="caps">ARM</span> included) so we are going to make a start with that; 2) <span class="caps">SUSE</span> are going to be doing another HackWeek (I think it is next week) which means Adrian, Alex, Dirk and anyone else that has knowledge, experience or interest can join in the fun and pain almost full time for a week ‚Äì let‚Äôs not kid ourselves here there is a high probability for lots of pain, but also fun ;-) Thing is HackWeek is not just for <span class="caps">SUSE</span> staff, it is also for the community. You can join in and spend some quality time on the project with those that know a whole heap of stuff, and learn from them and maybe even teach them something&nbsp;too.</p>

<p>We are going to be targeting ARMv7 nothing older I‚Äôm afraid this means <span class="caps">CORTEX</span>-<span class="caps">A8</span> and above (looking at <span class="caps">A9</span> primarily and then the new <span class="caps">A15</span> when it‚Äôs available), it gets too messy otherwise and it is already messy enough.If you have knowledge and experience, please help out.

One of the things that came out of the recent¬†[Geeko Love-In][1]¬†for me was a new project to immerse myself in within openSUSE. Yeah I know, we have enough existing projects already so why create a new one? Simples! Believe it or not but openSUSE is behind the curve in a specific segment, and that segment has yet to explode to its full potential. That segment is ARM.

      <p>Clarification <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Credits for open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> on <span class="caps">ARM</span>&nbsp;Chromebooks</p>
    </div>

    <p>After my <a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2012/10/25/geeko-goes-chrome.html" title="Geeko goes Chrome">post</a> yesterday on getting open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> on the new <span class="caps">ARM</span> Chromebook, a lot of interest was generated with discussions on various forms of media ‚Äì heck I even got Slashdotted (thanks :-) ). I read some but not all of them and even the comments. One thing popped out to me, and I feel I need to clarify some&nbsp;things.</p>

<ol>
<li> Whilst I do indeed work for <span class="caps">ARM</span>, my device was a private purchase and not provided to me by my employer. Luckily as part of my role I am able to spend time doing fun things like getting open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> on the&nbsp;Chromebook.</li>

After my [post][1] yesterday on getting openSUSE on the new ARM Chromebook, a lot of interest was generated with discussions on various forms of media ‚Äì heck I even got Slashdotted (thanks :-) ). I read some but not all of them and even the comments. One thing popped out to me, and I feel I need to clarify some things.

1.  Whilst I do indeed work for ARM, my device was a private purchase and not provided to me by my employer. Luckily as part of my role I am able to spend time doing fun things like getting openSUSE on the Chromebook.
2.  I have never taken credit for doing all the hard work of working out what needed to be done to get openSUSE on the Chromebook, the hard work was done by Olof Johanssen as I mentioned. He wrote up some excellent steps that were very easy to follow. I and all other people interested in getting Linux on the Chromebook regardless of distro are¬†indebted to Olof for his work.
3.  I am not responsible or incharge of getting openSUSE on ARM. It is a collaborative effort by the community, and there are many others that have put in a whole heap of hard work doing things that I can only aspire to do.

<p>I present what I have found so far below in a simple little pictorial guide of how to get to the general a11y settings.¬† I have tried four desktops ‚Äì <span class="caps">GNOME</span>, <span class="caps">KDE</span>, <span class="caps">XFCE</span> and <span class="caps">LXDE</span>, I couldn‚Äôt find anything in <span class="caps">LXDE</span> so I‚Äôll try and revisit it later once I‚Äôve had more&nbsp;time.</p>

<p><img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-3.png" alt="Step 3 to enable a11y on GNOME"></p>

<li>When you enable assitive technologies you need to restart your session for the changes to take effect.¬† You can easily do this by selecting the ‚ÄúClose and Log Out‚Äù button at the bottom of the&nbsp;window</li>

<p>Like I said this is just a very quick guide on how to do it.¬† I‚Äôm very sure there are more settings to deal with, especially in <span class="caps">KDE</span> but I don‚Äôt know them (yet).¬† If you do then please shout out and&nbsp;help.</p>

<p>One of the next things I need to learn is what applications are there specifically for a11y.¬† I know of a few but never used them (at least I dont think I have), and I‚Äôm sure I only know of a small&nbsp;number.</p>

So further to my post on¬†[a11y in openSUSE][1], I was asked how one would enable Accessibility.¬† Now to be honest I only¬†*kind of*¬†know how to do it in GNOME, so I set off on a little exploration of the other desktop environments.

 [1]: http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/05/06/getting-opensuse-from-a-to-y.html "Getting openSUSE from A to Y"

It may seem strange that I‚Äôm trying to champion a subject that I don‚Äôt really know, but that‚Äôs part of the reason¬†**why**¬†I‚Äôm doing so.¬† Accessibility isn‚Äôt supposed to a buzzword, it is meant to be a usable function for all.¬† Hopefully I can learn a bit along the way and get the message out there ‚Äì oh and if you could do the same that would just be spiffy ;-)

I present what I have found so far below in a simple little pictorial guide of how to get to the general a11y settings.¬† I have tried four desktops ‚Äì GNOME, KDE, XFCE and LXDE, I couldn‚Äôt find anything in LXDE so I‚Äôll try and revisit it later once I‚Äôve had more time.

For¬†**GNOME:**

1. In the main menu select ‚ÄúControl Center‚Äù

![Step 1 to enable a11y on GNOME][3]

 [3]: ../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-1.png

2. Then under the ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù section, select ‚ÄúAssistive Technologies‚Äù

![Step 2 to enable a11y on GNOME][4]

 [4]: ../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-2.5.png

3. Select ‚ÄúEnable assitive technologies‚Äù

![Step 3 to enable a11y on GNOME][5]

 [5]: ../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-3.png

4. When you enable assitive technologies you need to restart your session for the changes to take effect.¬† You can easily do this by selecting the ‚ÄúClose and Log Out‚Äù button at the bottom of the window

![Step 4 to enable a11y on GNOME][6]

 [6]: ../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-4.png

For¬†**KDE:**

1. In the Kicker menu select ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù then ‚ÄúSystem Settings‚Äù

![Step 1 to enable a11y on KDE][7]

 [7]: ../../../images/a11y/EnableKDEa11y-1.png

2. In the ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù section select ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù

![Step 2 to enable a11y on KDE][8]

 [8]: ../../../images/a11y/EnableKDEa11y-2.5.png

![Step 1 to enable a11y on XFCE][9]

 [9]: ../../../images/a11y/EnableXFCEa11y-1.5.png

Like I said this is just a very quick guide on how to do it.¬† I‚Äôm very sure there are more settings to deal with, especially in KDE but I don‚Äôt know them (yet).¬† If you do then please shout out and help.

One of the next things I need to learn is what applications are there specifically for a11y.¬† I know of a few but never used them (at least I dont think I have), and I‚Äôm sure I only know of a small number.;T;
I"Æ<p>So further to my post on¬†<a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/05/06/getting-opensuse-from-a-to-y.html" title="Getting openSUSE from A to Y">a11y in openSUSE</a>, I was asked how one would enable Accessibility.¬† Now to be honest I only¬†<em>kind of</em>¬†know how to do it in GNOME, so I set off on a little exploration of the other desktop environments.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that I‚Äôm trying to champion a subject that I don‚Äôt really know, but that‚Äôs part of the reason¬†<strong>why</strong>¬†I‚Äôm doing so.¬† Accessibility isn‚Äôt supposed to a buzzword, it is meant to be a usable function for all.¬† Hopefully I can learn a bit along the way and get the message out there ‚Äì oh and if you could do the same that would just be spiffy ;-)</p>

<p>I present what I have found so far below in a simple little pictorial guide of how to get to the general a11y settings.¬† I have tried four desktops ‚Äì GNOME, KDE, XFCE and LXDE, I couldn‚Äôt find anything in LXDE so I‚Äôll try and revisit it later once I‚Äôve had more time.</p>

<p>For¬†<strong>GNOME:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>In the main menu select ‚ÄúControl Center‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-1.png" alt="Step 1 to enable a11y on GNOME"></p>

<ol>
<li>Then under the ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù section, select ‚ÄúAssistive Technologies‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-2.5.png" alt="Step 2 to enable a11y on GNOME"></p>

<ol>
<li>Select ‚ÄúEnable assitive technologies‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-3.png" alt="Step 3 to enable a11y on GNOME"></p>

<ol>
<li>When you enable assitive technologies you need to restart your session for the changes to take effect.¬† You can easily do this by selecting the ‚ÄúClose and Log Out‚Äù button at the bottom of the window</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-4.png" alt="Step 4 to enable a11y on GNOME"></p>

<p>For¬†<strong>KDE:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>In the Kicker menu select ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù then ‚ÄúSystem Settings‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableKDEa11y-1.png" alt="Step 1 to enable a11y on KDE"></p>

<ol>
<li>In the ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù section select ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableKDEa11y-2.5.png" alt="Step 2 to enable a11y on KDE"></p>

<p>For¬†<strong>XFCE</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the menu select ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù then ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableXFCEa11y-1.5.png" alt="Step 1 to enable a11y on XFCE"></p>

<p>Like I said this is just a very quick guide on how to do it.¬† I‚Äôm very sure there are more settings to deal with, especially in KDE but I don‚Äôt know them (yet).¬† If you do then please shout out and help.</p>

I chose to base my plugin on an existing plugin, and my two options were creating a¬†[Blip.tv][2]¬†plugin (based on the¬†[Vimeo][3]¬†plugin) or a¬†[Gitorious][4]¬†plugin based on the¬†[Github][5]¬†plugin).¬† Guess which one I chose? No, not the Blip.tv one dufus!!

 [10]: http://fosdem.org/2010/ "Best FOSS meetup in Europe";T;
I"√<p>Suffice it to say, I‚Äôm actually enjoying my¬†<a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/" title="Life streaming how you want">Storytlr</a>¬†install ‚Äì maybe enjoy isn‚Äôt the right word but you get my drift, don‚Äôt you?¬† Well I was determined to loose my coding virginity, and Storytlr‚Äôs plugin system seemed to be the safest way to do so.</p>

<p>I chose to base my plugin on an existing plugin, and my two options were creating a¬†<a href="http://blip.tv/" title="Next Generation TV Network">Blip.tv</a>¬†plugin (based on the¬†<a href="http://vimeo.com/" title="Video Sharing For You">Vimeo</a>¬†plugin) or a¬†<a href="http://gitorious.org/" title="Open Source Git hosting">Gitorious</a>¬†plugin based on the¬†<a href="http://github.com/" title="Social Source code hosting">Github</a>¬†plugin).¬† Guess which one I chose? No, not the Blip.tv one dufus!!</p>

<p>So I can now present you with the shiny new Gitorious plugin for Storytlr.¬† You can grab the code from¬†<a href="http://github.com/awafaa/storytlr-plugin-gitorious" title="Gitorious plugin for storytlr">here</a>.¬† Yes I am acutely aware of the irony of hosting the code for this on Github :-) but to be honest for a coding dunce like moi, Github makes it easier.¬† Oh and the fact that the active developers are on Github makes things easier (for branching etc.).</p>

<p>Anyhow, just to prove it does work here‚Äôs a little snap of it in action:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2730/4328844248_94ef55f621_o.png" alt="Screenshot of my Gitorious plugin for Storytlr"></p>

<p>I do have to give big props to¬†<a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/" title="Velvet cach of Omaha">John Hobbs</a>¬†whos code I aped, and who code reviewed and fixed up my syntax ‚Äì thanks.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm off to Brussels in the morning for¬†<a href="http://fosdem.org/2010/" title="Best FOSS meetup in Europe">FOSDEM</a>, so I might/might not get round to doing my second plugin.¬† If you‚Äôre there look me up :-) </p>

      <p>When a Raspberry has all the flavour a Pi&nbsp;needs</p>
    </div>

    <p>I‚Äôm somewhat surprised at how many people are getting upset about the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Low cost ARM based board">RaspberryPi</a>. They are grumbling about how it is a weak, underpowered device with the only plus point being the exceptionally low price. ¬†People, this device was devised and built for a specific task ‚Äì getting children coding and learning about computers in general!! The price point is crucial, one could give it to a 4yr old (or 40yr old) and not worry too much if it¬†accidentally¬†gets juice poured on it or covered in chocolate&nbsp;spread.</p>

<p>Sure you can do the same sort of thing and then some more with a more powerful Pandaboard or any other ARMv7 powered device; but as a device to introduce little ones to the art of programming and all things computer related I think it is perfect. It is designed for the task of educating and as such doesn‚Äôt need or even want all the frills that a more powerful board can&nbsp;provide.</p>

<p>Not everything is about the highest specification. As long as there is enough oomph to get those inquisitive minds hacking, then there is no issue. Yes it would have been preferable if it was powered by an ARMv7, but the ARMv6 is more than capable for the task it is being used for. So what if one can‚Äôt run <span class="caps">KDE4</span> or <span class="caps">GNOME</span>-shell? Those little fingers need to learn to use an editor for code, so a simple <span class="caps">IDE</span> or dare I say it ‚Äì <span class="caps">VI</span> or <span class="caps">EMACS</span> ‚Äì don‚Äôt need all the flashy whizz bang the big DEs&nbsp;provide.</p>

<p>What would be even better is if we could get open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> on the darling little thing. The thing is we have placed our stake in the ground and are focusing on ARMv7. This does not mean we won‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to support ARMv6, we just need to focus otherwise we will never get anywhere. So if you would like to see a Raspberry flavoured Geeko then you are more than welcome to help out. The <span class="caps">ARM</span> team will help where we can and provide advice etc, but our time and effort is limited so don‚Äôt expect us to dive in and do the work for you&nbsp;;-)</p>

      <p>Droning Parrots and&nbsp;Javascript</p>

    <p>I was fortunate enough to get a present for surviving another year of life, a shiny new <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/" title="Consumer Quadricopter"><span class="caps">AR</span>.Drone<span class="caps">2.0</span></a>. This was something that I had desired sometime ago but then dismissed as an expensive toy with little expansion. That desire returned recently after being enlightened to the hacking opportunities, not just hacking the device directly but more around the hacking of applications to use with it. Yet again it was <a href="http://www.eschnou.com/" title="Eschnou's spot on the web">Laurent Eschenauer</a> to blame with his excellent <a href="http://eschnou.github.io/ardrone-webflight/" title="ardrone-webflight homepage">ardrone-webflight</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://nodecopter.com/" title="NodeCopter"><img src="../../../images/nodecopter-logo.png" alt="NodeCopter"></a></p>

<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve really looked at <a href="http://nodejs.org/" title="Server based JavaScript">node.js</a>, and it is actually a pretty powerful framework. Laurent and co have done a fabulous job at hooking into the APIs that are exposed by the&nbsp;<span class="caps">AR</span>.Drone<span class="caps">2.0.</span> </p>

I was fortunate enough to get a present for surviving another year of life, a shiny new [AR.Drone2.0][1]. This was something that I had desired sometime ago but then dismissed as an expensive toy with little expansion. That desire returned recently after being enlightened to the hacking opportunities, not just hacking the device directly but more around the hacking of applications to use with it. Yet again it was [Laurent Eschenauer][2] to blame with his excellent [ardrone-webflight][3].

This is the first time I've really looked at [node.js][6], and it is actually a pretty powerful framework. Laurent and co have done a fabulous job at hooking into the APIs that are exposed by the AR.Drone2.0.

    <p>Yup, I‚Äôm still trying to get us, the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Community, to discuss ways we can improve ourselves.¬† This time round I‚Äôm going to look at Education, Coaching and Teamwork.¬† Again there is nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary here, but these are topics I feel are easily forgotten or&nbsp;misunderstood.</p>

<p>One item that seems to pop up fairly regularily regardless of which side of the fence you‚Äôre on (Novell employee or not), is community contribution and ownership.¬† Basically some people think getting code/packages/whatever into open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> is harder than getting a rocking horse to poop.¬† Can I just say it isn‚Äôt ‚Äì honest! You just need to know the process to do it.¬† The flip side of the conversation is, why aren‚Äôt more non-Novellians putting more code and what not into open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>?¬† Maybe because they don‚Äôt know or understand the process?¬† So basically we are all to blame, non-Novellians for not asking for help/clarification and Novellians for not going out there and&nbsp;teaching.</p>

<p>So how do we educate?¬† Firstly that good old method of documentation, yup it‚Äôs boring and tedious at times but if done right can save a whole load of hassle.¬† It does¬†<strong>not</strong>¬†mean people can just respond to calls for help with <span class="caps">RTFM</span>, it mean we have to point people to the correct section of documentaion and also give a little reason as to why they should read it.¬† Documentation isn‚Äôt the only method we can use, after all we are well and truly in the Web <span class="caps">2.0</span> buzzword bingo era; let‚Äôs use video (screencast/presentation/podcast), anotated images, code examples, comic strips, audio (regular podcast or one offs), and last but not least we could always throw a bit of each into a blog post :-)¬† We need more of the modern methods, they‚Äôre much more palatable and fun from a consumer&nbsp;perspective.</p>

<p>Sometimes just having all this information can be daunting, and you can easily get lost in it all.¬† So we need coaching, some gentle guidance and when needed a good slap!¬† If we really want more people to take ownership then let‚Äôs help them take ownership.¬† Just throwing it out there and hoping for the best is good for no-one, and if anything will just create a bad atmosphere and generate friction.¬† Let‚Äôs make sure that those that want to do something get as much help as we can give, it may mean that Novellians have to spend a little bit of time holding people‚Äôs hands but we will all see the gain.¬† Don‚Äôt think that I would expect it all the time, if you take it for granted you won‚Äôt get the oportunity again.¬† So to those that want the help, make sure you make it clear that you do want and need help and also try and calm any fears that it‚Äôs a one off glory hunting mission.¬† It is a commitment from all parties, and you really need to stick with it.¬† It may well be that the best person for coaching you isn‚Äôt a Novell employee, so ask around.¬† We can all teach each other a thing or two.¬† A great example of coaching is Darix and all the others in the Buildservice irc channel and mailing list.¬† Package building can be really daunting, and getting it right can be tricky at times.¬† Those guys and gals there are a huge asset to the community, they‚Äôre friendly and very knowledgable.¬† You just need to not be afraid to ask a question.¬† If you don‚Äôt understand an answer, say so!¬† If you learn something document it and let everyone else&nbsp;know.</p>

<p>Lastly try and not go it alone.¬† If you can do something as part of a team, then that‚Äôs a massive win for us all too.¬† You don‚Äôt have to shoulder all the burden, so you reduce the risk of burn out and we reduce the risk of you getting angry and leaving either the thing you were doing or worse off you leaving open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> entirely.¬† Getting other people‚Äôs input can most of the time improve things and spreading the workload also means more peoiple have visibility on what is happening.¬† So should you not be able to continue for whatever reason (hopefully a valid one, and not because you‚Äôre bored) then the ball keeps rolling.¬† It also helps with the whole knowledge sharing aspect, everyone learns a bit and as we grow stronger and brighter as a whole.¬† The borg is strong because it is made up of many, we can be&nbsp;stronger.</p>

<p>So have you got any examples of where you recieved education/coaching, maybe you had a bad experience trying to get some?¬† Please let me and everyone know.¬† We need to learn from our actions, and if we don‚Äôt know whether they were good or bad how can we improve?¬† If you have an idea on what needs/can be done then discuss it.¬† Remember this isn‚Äôt about me, but about you the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community.¬† Let‚Äôs step up and really make a difference, and prove to all those naysayers that we do care and are actually doing something about&nbsp;it.</p>

    <div class="title">
      <p>Getting open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> from A to&nbsp;Y</p>
    </div>

    <p>There is an 13 letter word that begins with ‚Äúa‚Äù and ends with ‚Äúy‚Äù, can you guess what it is?¬† Yup,¬†<em>a11y</em>¬†is what I‚Äôm on about, also known as<em>Accessibility</em>.</p>

<p>I think the subject of a11y is possibly a very misunderstood one, I for one incorrectly associated it with disabled use of a computer.¬† I have been corrected (on more than one occasion) to the fact that Accessibility actually refers to the ability for anybody to be able to use a computer (or any other device) regardless of any impairment they might have.¬† So that means both people with¬†<strong>and</strong>¬†without disabilities are a11y users.¬† In addition to that, a11y can also help developers to automate testing ‚Äì quite often <span class="caps">UI</span>&nbsp;testing.</p>

<p>An extreme case of a11y usage could be a blind person who can‚Äôt see a <span class="caps">GUI</span> the way someone with 20/20 vision can, or someone with spectacles.¬† They may have to use a tool called a screen reader (<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca" title="Orca Screen Reader">Orca</a>¬†is common on Linux) that describes what‚Äôs on the screen by speaking through the speakers.¬† So in order to get something like Orca to work, application UIs need to be understandable by Orca in a programmatic way and that pays off with the automated&nbsp;testing.</p>

<p>So what‚Äôs the issue?¬† Well from what I can see, and what I have heard, is that open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> sucks the goat‚Äôs back-end when it come‚Äôs to a11y.¬† In all honesty I don‚Äôt have any real evidence to back this claim, but one thing I do know is that we don‚Äôt really do much as a community about it.¬† Before anyone flips this to a ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt Novell paying for people to work on it full time‚Äù argument, shush!¬† This is a misconception that I think people have about corporate sponsors to a project; as it happens Novell does employ some folks to work on a11y indirectly thanks to the working partnership with Microsoft, check out the great work by the¬†<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/A11y" title="Accessibilty by Mono">Mono a11y team</a>.¬† If we as a community want to get some dedicated resources assigned to anything, we need to make the case first, we have to show that as a community we feel strongly about the subject and show to whomever is writing the cheques that we are doing the job but could do with a helping&nbsp;hand.</p>

<p>As an example, Red Hat and Canonical do not have dedicated a11y developers but they¬†<strong>do</strong>¬†have developers who keep a11y foremost in their minds as they develop and innovate projects for the masses.¬† We don‚Äôt really have that as such.¬† This is where we can reach out to upstream and ask for some help and guidance.¬† Both¬†<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Accessibility" title="GNOME Accessibility Team"><span class="caps">GNOME</span></a>¬†and¬†<a href="http://accessibility.kde.org/" title="KDE Accessibility Team"><span class="caps">KDE</span></a>¬†have a11y teams, although it appears that the former is more&nbsp;active.</p>

<p>Accessibility is not an easy topic to tackle.¬† If one doesn‚Äôt understand the tools, how does one ensure the pieces you put together are working?¬† So how about we start learning, and do it well?¬† This is a subject that affects¬†<strong>all</strong>users and developers, and is something that all DEs can jump on and help out.¬† Heck we may even learn a thing or two about how our colleagues/friends/enemies work ;-)¬† It affects us all, and as such we all need to&nbsp;help.</p>

<p>The European Eunion feels fairly strongly about Accessibility and as such there are numerous laws in place to try and ensure that users that require it are given an even chance.¬† They have also set up¬†<a href="http://www.aegis-project.eu/" title="AEGIS Project"><span class="caps">AEGIS</span></a>¬†to promote a11y usage.¬† In the United states the National Science Foundation is helping to fund¬†<a href="http://hfoss.org/" title="HFOSS Project"><span class="caps">HFOSS</span></a>¬†to help the a11y cause.¬† So as you can see there‚Äôs a fairly big push from it from central government.¬† If we don‚Äôt follow their example and neglect to have a11y in our focused sights I fear it could lead to a slippery downward slope for open<span class="caps">SUSE.</span>¬† If that sounds melodramatic then maybe it is, but it is something that I honestly do feel could affect us&nbsp;badly.</p>

<p>A quick and dirty way to get into a11y is to just enable accessibility in your session.¬† You shouldn‚Äôt notice any difference, if you do then that‚Äôs a bug!¬† File the bug, and make sure you mention that you have a11y&nbsp;enabled.</p>

<p>So as a community do you think this is something we could get behind?¬† I would love to see open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> <span class="caps">12.0</span> released as the most accessible distribution; Ubuntu currently makes the statement that they are the most accessible desktop system available and this is a statement I would love to show as false!¬† Not through animosity but through sheer prowess of the Geeko!¬† To do that we (yes that means you at the back, listening to your boom boom music and chatting to your friends on FaceSpace) have to roll our sleeves up and get educated and start&nbsp;educating!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not looking for people to nod in agreement with my call for help, that is easy to do.¬† What I‚Äôm looking for is a concerted effort by all in the community to help make us Number 1!¬† There are lots of different ways to do this, but to do so we need to unite as one and work cohesively.¬† So please, help me to help everyone, and make open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> that much&nbsp;better!</p>

There is an 13 letter word that begins with ‚Äúa‚Äù and ends with ‚Äúy‚Äù, can you guess what it is?¬† Yup,¬†*a11y*¬†is what I‚Äôm on about, also known as*Accessibility*.

I think the subject of a11y is possibly a very misunderstood one, I for one incorrectly associated it with disabled use of a computer.¬† I have been corrected (on more than one occasion) to the fact that Accessibility actually refers to the ability for anybody to be able to use a computer (or any other device) regardless of any impairment they might have.¬† So that means both people with¬†**and**¬†without disabilities are a11y users.¬† In addition to that, a11y can also help developers to automate testing ‚Äì quite often UI testing.

An extreme case of a11y usage could be a blind person who can‚Äôt see a GUI the way someone with 20/20 vision can, or someone with spectacles.¬† They may have to use a tool called a screen reader ([Orca][1]¬†is common on Linux) that describes what‚Äôs on the screen by speaking through the speakers.¬† So in order to get something like Orca to work, application UIs need to be understandable by Orca in a programmatic way and that pays off with the automated testing.

 [1]: http://live.gnome.org/Orca "Orca Screen Reader"

So what‚Äôs the issue?¬† Well from what I can see, and what I have heard, is that openSUSE sucks the goat‚Äôs back-end when it come‚Äôs to a11y.¬† In all honesty I don‚Äôt have any real evidence to back this claim, but one thing I do know is that we don‚Äôt really do much as a community about it.¬† Before anyone flips this to a ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt Novell paying for people to work on it full time‚Äù argument, shush!¬† This is a misconception that I think people have about corporate sponsors to a project; as it happens Novell does employ some folks to work on a11y indirectly thanks to the working partnership with Microsoft, check out the great work by the¬†[Mono a11y team][2].¬† If we as a community want to get some dedicated resources assigned to anything, we need to make the case first, we have to show that as a community we feel strongly about the subject and show to whomever is writing the cheques that we are doing the job but could do with a helping hand.

As an example, Red Hat and Canonical do not have dedicated a11y developers but they¬†**do**¬†have developers who keep a11y foremost in their minds as they develop and innovate projects for the masses.¬† We don‚Äôt really have that as such.¬† This is where we can reach out to upstream and ask for some help and guidance.¬† Both¬†[GNOME][3]¬†and¬†[KDE][4]¬†have a11y teams, although it appears that the former is more active.

 [4]: http://accessibility.kde.org/ "KDE Accessibility Team"

Accessibility is not an easy topic to tackle.¬† If one doesn‚Äôt understand the tools, how does one ensure the pieces you put together are working?¬† So how about we start learning, and do it well?¬† This is a subject that affects¬†**all**users and developers, and is something that all DEs can jump on and help out.¬† Heck we may even learn a thing or two about how our colleagues/friends/enemies work ;-)¬† It affects us all, and as such we all need to help.

The European Eunion feels fairly strongly about Accessibility and as such there are numerous laws in place to try and ensure that users that require it are given an even chance.¬† They have also set up¬†[AEGIS][6]¬†to promote a11y usage.¬† In the United states the National Science Foundation is helping to fund¬†[HFOSS][7]¬†to help the a11y cause.¬† So as you can see there‚Äôs a fairly big push from it from central government.¬† If we don‚Äôt follow their example and neglect to have a11y in our focused sights I fear it could lead to a slippery downward slope for openSUSE.¬† If that sounds melodramatic then maybe it is, but it is something that I honestly do feel could affect us badly.

A quick and dirty way to get into a11y is to just enable accessibility in your session.¬† You shouldn‚Äôt notice any difference, if you do then that‚Äôs a bug!¬† File the bug, and make sure you mention that you have a11y enabled.

So as a community do you think this is something we could get behind?¬† I would love to see openSUSE 12.0 released as the most accessible distribution; Ubuntu currently makes the statement that they are the most accessible desktop system available and this is a statement I would love to show as false!¬† Not through animosity but through sheer prowess of the Geeko!¬† To do that we (yes that means you at the back, listening to your boom boom music and chatting to your friends on FaceSpace) have to roll our sleeves up and get educated and start educating!

I‚Äôm not looking for people to nod in agreement with my call for help, that is easy to do.¬† What I‚Äôm looking for is a concerted effort by all in the community to help make us Number 1!¬† There are lots of different ways to do this, but to do so we need to unite as one and work cohesively.¬† So please, help me to help everyone, and make openSUSE that much better!;T;

      <p>Community Discussion -&nbsp;Part1</p>
    </div>

    <p>I thought it would be a good idea to try and engage you ‚Äì the fine open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community ‚Äì in discussion about ‚ÄúUs‚Äù the Community.¬† We seemed to have been spoiled by having a Community Manager, people kind of seemed to let him do the work or worse expected him to do so.¬† Now that we don‚Äôt have that position any more we need to go back to basics and start rolling our sleeves up.¬† We‚Äôve started but we have much to do.¬† As such this is the first in I‚Äôm not sure how many posts on the&nbsp;subject.</p>

<p>To save me having to repeat myself constantly I‚Äôll do a small disclaimer&nbsp;now: 
<strong><span class="caps">THESE</span> <span class="caps">ARE</span> <span class="caps">MY</span> <span class="caps">OPINIONS</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">THOUGHTS</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">GOSPEL</span>! I <span class="caps">AM</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">EMPLOYED</span> <span class="caps">BY</span> <span class="caps">NOVELL</span>! I <span class="caps">WANT</span> <span class="caps">TO</span> <span class="caps">GET</span> A <span class="caps">DISCUSSION</span> <span class="caps">GOING</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> A <span class="caps">FLAME</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">WAR</span>!</strong></p>

<p>In my opinion this topic is linked to my previous post about the ‚Äú<a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/02/17/planning-for-the-future.html" title="blog post on planning for the future">Planning For The Future</a>‚Äú.¬† The key here is to remain agile, able to flex, roll, bounce, jump and basically move with the times.¬† If we impose strict rigid requirements then things will start to crack and&nbsp;crumble.</p>

<p>So what do I see as key items needed to enable more community contributions, and get more non-Novellians involved in taking a more (pro)active role in the&nbsp;Project?</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Tools</strong>¬†- we need an enabler of sorts that lets people start off small and get to grips with how things move, from there they can grow out and&nbsp;up.</li>
<li>  <strong>Transparency</strong>¬†- ensuring that the decisions that are made are clear concise and understandable.¬† I‚Äôm ure not everyone will like the decisions but if they can see the reasons behind it then they can work with it and maybe come up with a better&nbsp;alternative.</li>
<li>  <strong>Communicate</strong>¬†- this is something that has improved a lot over time but still has some ways to go.¬† There are certain parties that still don‚Äôt understand how to communicate with the wider community but they can and are an integral part of the ecosystem, we need to educate and help them get&nbsp;better.</li>
<li>  <strong>Coach</strong>¬†- no-one can get to a suitable proficiency in any subject whether it be academic/sporting/whatever without some form of tutelage.¬† To help lighten the work load on the employees that are trying to juggle between their enterprise workload and community workload we need to have them spend some time away from their corporate duties to help with some knowledge and skill&nbsp;sharing.</li>
<li>  <strong>Teamwork</strong>¬†- stop depending on individuals, whether they are Novellian or non-Novellian one person can‚Äôt do it all in their supposed subject matter of&nbsp;expertise.</li>
<li>  <strong>Educate</strong>¬†- self market, not just to the outside world but internally too.¬† The open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community is too modest for it‚Äôs own good at times, we need to be more vocal about all the fantastic stuff we do.¬† We have to be clear and concise in the message we send out across the&nbsp;community.</li>
<li>  <strong>Learn</strong>¬†- look at our peers and take a leaf out of their book sometimes.¬† Believe it or not they do do things right sometimes ;-) I‚Äôm not saying copy, but try and take the bits that are needed and roll it into what you&nbsp;want.</li>
<li>  <strong>Collaborate</strong>¬†- work with our peers on universal matters.¬† This doesn‚Äôt just mean cross-desktop, but also cross-project and&nbsp;cross-distro.</li>
<li>  <strong>Listen</strong>¬†- take a moment to hear what is being said.¬† Just taking that little bit of extra time can help isolate the noise from the message and help you understand what is being said/asked.¬† Remember that not everyone is a native speaker of your language so things might get lost/confused in translation, which is where that little bit of time will&nbsp;help.</li>
<li>  <strong>Lead</strong>¬†- you don‚Äôt have to do things by committee.¬† If you see something that needs/can be done just do it!¬† We dither around far too much waiting for someone else to do it.¬† Do what you can and then communicate what you‚Äôve done and what if anything is&nbsp;outstanding.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the above link into one another almost inextricably, so not doing one will most likely have an detrimental effect on the&nbsp;rest.</p>

I thought it would be a good idea to try and engage you ‚Äì the fine openSUSE community ‚Äì in discussion about ‚ÄúUs‚Äù the Community.¬† We seemed to have been spoiled by having a Community Manager, people kind of seemed to let him do the work or worse expected him to do so.¬† Now that we don‚Äôt have that position any more we need to go back to basics and start rolling our sleeves up.¬† We‚Äôve started but we have much to do.¬† As such this is the first in I‚Äôm not sure how many posts on the subject.

To save me having to repeat myself constantly I‚Äôll do a small disclaimer now: 
**THESE ARE MY OPINIONS AND THOUGHTS AND NOT GOSPEL! I AM NOT EMPLOYED BY NOVELL! I WANT TO GET A DISCUSSION GOING NOT A FLAME WAR!**

In my opinion this topic is linked to my previous post about the ‚Äú[Planning For The Future][1]‚Äú.¬† The key here is to remain agile, able to flex, roll, bounce, jump and basically move with the times.¬† If we impose strict rigid requirements then things will start to crack and crumble.

 [1]: http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/02/17/planning-for-the-future.html "blog post on planning for the future"

So what do I see as key items needed to enable more community contributions, and get more non-Novellians involved in taking a more (pro)active role in the Project?

*   **Tools**¬†- we need an enabler of sorts that lets people start off small and get to grips with how things move, from there they can grow out and up.
*   **Transparency**¬†- ensuring that the decisions that are made are clear concise and understandable.¬† I‚Äôm ure not everyone will like the decisions but if they can see the reasons behind it then they can work with it and maybe come up with a better alternative.
*   **Communicate**¬†- this is something that has improved a lot over time but still has some ways to go.¬† There are certain parties that still don‚Äôt understand how to communicate with the wider community but they can and are an integral part of the ecosystem, we need to educate and help them get better.
*   **Coach**¬†- no-one can get to a suitable proficiency in any subject whether it be academic/sporting/whatever without some form of tutelage.¬† To help lighten the work load on the employees that are trying to juggle between their enterprise workload and community workload we need to have them spend some time away from their corporate duties to help with some knowledge and skill sharing.
*   **Teamwork**¬†- stop depending on individuals, whether they are Novellian or non-Novellian one person can‚Äôt do it all in their supposed subject matter of expertise.
*   **Educate**¬†- self market, not just to the outside world but internally too.¬† The openSUSE community is too modest for it‚Äôs own good at times, we need to be more vocal about all the fantastic stuff we do.¬† We have to be clear and concise in the message we send out across the community.
*   **Learn**¬†- look at our peers and take a leaf out of their book sometimes.¬† Believe it or not they do do things right sometimes ;-) I‚Äôm not saying copy, but try and take the bits that are needed and roll it into what you want.
*   **Collaborate**¬†- work with our peers on universal matters.¬† This doesn‚Äôt just mean cross-desktop, but also cross-project and cross-distro.
*   **Listen**¬†- take a moment to hear what is being said.¬† Just taking that little bit of extra time can help isolate the noise from the message and help you understand what is being said/asked.¬† Remember that not everyone is a native speaker of your language so things might get lost/confused in translation, which is where that little bit of time will help.
*   **Lead**¬†- you don‚Äôt have to do things by committee.¬† If you see something that needs/can be done just do it!¬† We dither around far too much waiting for someone else to do it.¬† Do what you can and then communicate what you‚Äôve done and what if anything is outstanding.

All the above link into one another almost inextricably, so not doing one will most likely have an detrimental effect on the rest.

We already have several items that are great examples of how the community can get on and do something great, a sample of those are:

*   **openSUSE Education**¬†- this team started from very little and have created one of the best educational derivatives of any distro.¬† There is a good mix of people involved, and no-one is paid to do it, even on the Novell side.¬† They‚Äôre a well knit team of contributors that are more than happy to help people wanting to help them. They saw a gap and filled it, by taking a leaf out of one of our peers‚Äô book and enhanced it.
*   **Packman**¬†- the great resource for the common user.¬† They are one of the oldest community based projects relating to openSUSE or its earlier iterations that I remember.¬† They‚Äôre approachable friendly and have a heck of a lot of knowledge.¬† They saw a need and did it.
*   **LXDE**¬†- a new desktop environment that is only a couple of years old.¬† It has effectively been packaged from scratch by one person and is now included in Factory and the upcoming 11.3 release.¬† There was no committee discusion about doe we want it in or should we have it in, there was an opportunity and it was capitalised on.

Now I‚Äôd love to hear from people on what they think is missing or blocking them from doing any/all of the above, I‚Äôd also like to know what it is that people find awkward or difficult in joining in and being more active.¬† Don‚Äôt get me wrong I appreciate one of the most precious and costly commodities is pretty much standard across the board ‚Äì that of time.¬† I suffer from that problem as much as anyone, but it doesn‚Äôt stop me from contributing, sometimes I just ave to slow down and trickle the contributions rather than pour them.¬† So let‚Äôs start the conversation and get ideas and complaints out in the open.¬† If you don‚Äôt say it how are people going to know about it?

Remember that this is an open dialogue.¬† Pot shots, defamation of character, flaming, and anything non-constructive will NOT be tolerated.¬† Let‚Äôs keep it clean and helpful.¬† Listing things that our peers do better than us and also what they do worse than us would most likely open eyes.

How one gets to the future greatly depends on how one deals with the present and learns from the past.;T;

<p>As I¬†<a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/09/30/target-arm-hardware.html" title="Target ARM hardware decision">mentioned</a>¬†before, we have an initial target platform identified for testing the work of all those involved in the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> <span class="caps">ARM</span> port. The problem is we need to obtain the&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>I am in discussions trying to get some corporate sponsorship of hardware, but we can not rely soley on those kind companies that would like to see us succeed. We as a community need to help ourselves succeed, as such I‚Äôve set up a¬†<a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16098" title="openSUSE ARM pledgie campaign">campaign</a>¬†on Pledgie to enable us the community to contribute to the effort for obtaining&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>With these funds, we the community will be able to purchase 5 (maybe more) PandaBoards which will help developers fix packages and also test the port to ensure everything works. Until the new <span class="caps">ARM</span> based chipsets are released, which could be the middle of next year, we will also need a substantial number of boards to provide a decent enough amount of compute power for <span class="caps">OBS</span> to build natively. ¬†<span class="caps">OBS</span> is great, but there are limitations with emulating the environment in Qemu. Having physical hardware will remove these limitations and enable us to prove that open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> is a world class <span class="caps">ARM</span>&nbsp;distirbution.</p>

<p>So please help us to help you, donate what you can so that we can reach our goal of&nbsp;‚Ç¨1,000.</p>

As I¬†[mentioned][2]¬†before, we have an initial target platform identified for testing the work of all those involved in the openSUSE ARM port. The problem is we need to obtain the hardware.

 [2]: http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/09/30/target-arm-hardware.html "Target ARM hardware decision"

I am in discussions trying to get some corporate sponsorship of hardware, but we can not rely soley on those kind companies that would like to see us succeed. We as a community need to help ourselves succeed, as such I‚Äôve set up a¬†[campaign][3]¬†on Pledgie to enable us the community to contribute to the effort for obtaining hardware.

With these funds, we the community will be able to purchase 5 (maybe more) PandaBoards which will help developers fix packages and also test the port to ensure everything works. Until the new ARM based chipsets are released, which could be the middle of next year, we will also need a substantial number of boards to provide a decent enough amount of compute power for OBS to build natively. ¬†OBS is great, but there are limitations with emulating the environment in Qemu. Having physical hardware will remove these limitations and enable us to prove that openSUSE is a world class ARM distirbution.

So please help us to help you, donate what you can so that we can reach our goal of ‚Ç¨1,000.

      <p>Community Discussion - Part 6&nbsp;Feedback</p>
    </div>

    <p>You have to grant me that I‚Äôm persistent&nbsp;;-)</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK</span> so this time round I thought I‚Äôd do a quick round up of some of the feedback that I‚Äôve received so far ‚Äì some of it has been in the form of comments on this here blog, others have been responses on mailing lists, and some has been from direct converstation with me.¬† I‚Äôd love to get more from you, and ultimately you get more from&nbsp;yourselves.</p>

<p>The following is in no particular order, and if anyone has anything else to add then please let me know.¬† Also remember this is a discussion so feel free to discuss sensibly and calmly ‚Äì usual flame ban is in place ;-)&nbsp;:</p>

<ol>
<li> Still a lot of animosity between <span class="caps">KDE</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">GNOME</span> within&nbsp;open<span class="caps">SUSE.</span></li>
<li> The Community Manager role is too focused on marketing, and not the Community.¬† People would like to see a more operational role, getting involved with the actual&nbsp;project.</li>
<li> It is unclear as to what Novell (being the project sponsor) would like from the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Project, and how do the two fit with each&nbsp;other.</li>
<li> There is a percieved distrust of external contributors, their code isnt good enough&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li> open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> needs to be pushed more by all parties.¬† There is a distinct lack of overt and covert&nbsp;marketing.</li>
<li> There is too much focus on Novell&nbsp;employees.</li>
<li> open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> has no clear goal or direction,¬† open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> appears to be fumbling along not really sure of what it wants or how to do&nbsp;things.</li>
<li> There is too much infrastucture, or the infrastructure isn‚Äôt easy to navigate or&nbsp;understand.</li>
<li> Sometimes we are starting to lag behind upstream and don‚Äôt necessarily keep up with the latest and greatest that is out&nbsp;there.</li>
<li>There is too much reliance on a handful of individuals, there isn‚Äôt a decent spread of knowledge/power amongst&nbsp;teams.</li>
<li>There doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough ‚Äúfull time‚Äù (I believe Novell employee is meant here) people involved in some teams which are core to both open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> and&nbsp;<span class="caps">SLE.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>So do you agree with what some of your peers say?¬† If not then step up and let your voice be heard, even if you do let it be known.¬† Remember, as a member of the community you have a chance to influence your surroundings ‚Äì not taking any action will only mean that you are to blame not those that took action that you don‚Äôt agree&nbsp;with.</p>

The following is in no particular order, and if anyone has anything else to add then please let me know.¬† Also remember this is a discussion so feel free to discuss sensibly and calmly ‚Äì usual flame ban is in place ;-) :

1.  Still a lot of animosity between KDE & GNOME within openSUSE.
2.  The Community Manager role is too focused on marketing, and not the Community.¬† People would like to see a more operational role, getting involved with the actual project.
3.  It is unclear as to what Novell (being the project sponsor) would like from the openSUSE Project, and how do the two fit with each other.
4.  There is a percieved distrust of external contributors, their code isnt good enough etc.
5.  openSUSE needs to be pushed more by all parties.¬† There is a distinct lack of overt and covert marketing.
6.  There is too much focus on Novell employees.
7.  openSUSE has no clear goal or direction,¬† openSUSE appears to be fumbling along not really sure of what it wants or how to do things.
8.  There is too much infrastucture, or the infrastructure isn‚Äôt easy to navigate or understand.
9.  Sometimes we are starting to lag behind upstream and don‚Äôt necessarily keep up with the latest and greatest that is out there.
10. There is too much reliance on a handful of individuals, there isn‚Äôt a decent spread of knowledge/power amongst teams.
11. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough ‚Äúfull time‚Äù (I believe Novell employee is meant here) people involved in some teams which are core to both openSUSE and SLE.

So do you agree with what some of your peers say?¬† If not then step up and let your voice be heard, even if you do let it be known.¬† Remember, as a member of the community you have a chance to influence your surroundings ‚Äì not taking any action will only mean that you are to blame not those that took action that you don‚Äôt agree with.;T;

With that in mind Joop Boonen was good enough to pull up a list of the packages required to build the Jeos pattern, I‚Äôve added it to the¬†[wiki][1]¬†in a table to show the status of the required packages. If you would like to help out, look at the the¬†[Jeos Package List page][2]¬†and add your name in the column and when you submit a fix pop the SR number in too.

    <div class="title">
      <p>Changed Blogging System&nbsp;Again</p>
    </div>

    <p>It&#8217;s been almost 18 months since I last made any <a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2012/02/17/update-to-europeanwafaa.html" title="European Wafaa moves to Wordpress">change</a> to this site, and I&#8217;ve been meaning to do it for a while. In all honesty, it&#8217;s been a while since I last blogged so I thought it was as good a time as any. Thanks to the likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/awafaa" title="Me on Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/103092666279088875227" title="Me on Google+">Google+</a>, and my <a href="http://forums.arm.com/index.php?app=core&amp;module=search&amp;do=user_activity&amp;search_app=blog&amp;mid=123654&amp;userMode=&amp;sid=104957ef65b11d07747c3f0a9b12527d" title="My corporate blog posts">corporate</a> blog I&#8217;m finding myself blogging less an&nbsp;less.</p>

<p>As my blog is getting less content, is it really worth running an sql server etc? I don&#8217;t think it is. There&#8217;s the system overhead (I&#8217;ll explain why I&#8217;m thinking about system overhead in another post), the maintanence of a critical component, the backups etc. <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress blogging tool">WordPress</a> is <span class="caps">OK</span>, but it really is overkill for simple blogging. After seeing peers, friends, and general interweb related buzz, I finally decided to move and use a static site generator. Problem is which one - there are loads?! I read and an <span class="caps">LWN</span> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/541299/" title="LWN article on static site generators">article</a> which somewhat helped, so now I needed to choose. I finally bit the bullet and went for <a href="http://nanoc.ws" title="Nanoc, a Ruby based static site generator">Nanoc</a> after recommendations from trusted&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>So far I&#8217;m loving it. I had already started to get into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" title="Wikipedia's entry on Markdown">Markdown</a>, so creating content using the language was easy enough (I&#8217;m by no means an expert though). I get most of the functions that I want straight out of the box, it renders perfectly regardless of browser - desktop or mobile, it is immensly portable, backups are a breeze, and overall maintanence is simple. I regularily ask myself why I took so long to make the&nbsp;move.</p>

<p>As part of the move I&#8217;ve also rejigged URLs etc, so if you crazily had my blog bookmarked for whatever reason you will need to update. I&#8217;ve not quite finished fiddling yet, I&#8217;ve not implemented comments yet, but you could always use G+ or whatever in the meantime. I also want to tweak the theme and some other bits. I&#8217;d like to thank <a href="http://nordisch.org/" title="darix's blog">Marcus Ruckert</a> for helping me with some of the code tweaks, <a href="http://ithaca.arpinum.org/" title="Ithaca's blog">Peter Aronoff</a> for the current theme and some&nbsp;ideas.</p>

It's been almost 18 months since I last made any [change][1] to this site, and I've been meaning to do it for a while. In all honesty, it's been a while since I last blogged so I thought it was as good a time as any. Thanks to the likes of [Twitter][2] and [Google+][3], and my [corporate][4] blog I'm finding myself blogging less an less.

As my blog is getting less content, is it really worth running an sql server etc? I don't think it is. There's the system overhead (I'll explain why I'm thinking about system overhead in another post), the maintanence of a critical component, the backups etc. [WordPress][5] is OK, but it really is overkill for simple blogging. After seeing peers, friends, and general interweb related buzz, I finally decided to move and use a static site generator. Problem is which one - there are loads?! I read and an LWN [article][6] which somewhat helped, so now I needed to choose. I finally bit the bullet and went for [Nanoc][7] after recommendations from trusted people.

So far I'm loving it. I had already started to get into [Markdown][8], so creating content using the language was easy enough (I'm by no means an expert though). I get most of the functions that I want straight out of the box, it renders perfectly regardless of browser - desktop or mobile, it is immensly portable, backups are a breeze, and overall maintanence is simple. I regularily ask myself why I took so long to make the move.

As part of the move I've also rejigged URLs etc, so if you crazily had my blog bookmarked for whatever reason you will need to update. I've not quite finished fiddling yet, I've not implemented comments yet, but you could always use G+ or whatever in the meantime. I also want to tweak the theme and some other bits. I'd like to thank [Marcus Ruckert][9] for helping me with some of the code tweaks, [Peter Aronoff][10] for the current theme and some ideas.

<p>Why? Simples, there are no <span class="caps">ODF</span> compatible products on Android for reading <span class="amp">&amp;</span> writing.

<p>Now if I was a half decent hacker, this may not have been such a big deal.¬† Problem is I‚Äôm an absolutley crap hacker, with almost no experience or knowledge of Android or LibreOffice development. So why on earth would I try and do such a monumentally painful task? Two reasons ‚Äì 1. I was challenged by an engineer that I respect to do it. 2. I‚Äôve got an itch that needs scratching (actually I‚Äôm riddled with itches, and the Doc confirms it isn‚Äôt a medical condition ;-)&nbsp;).</p>

<p>So how to go about it? I‚Äôm still working that one out. As it stands open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> doesn‚Äôt provide the necessary tools for the job ‚Äì no decent <span class="caps">ARM</span> port :( So I‚Äôm going to have a play with Debian ‚Äì after all <span class="caps">6.0</span> Squeeze is just out the oven so now‚Äôs as good a time as any. If that doesn‚Äôt work out I‚Äôll give Ubuntu a whirl.¬† Never fear oh mighty Geeko lovers ‚Äì these alien installations will be going on my test machine. My primary machine is still running open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>, with&nbsp;<span class="caps">GNOME3.</span></p>

<p>I‚Äôll try and document my trip through pain and fun, if for nothing else humour for those more seasoned than me at doing cooky stuff like&nbsp;this.</p>

<p>Just as a little side note ‚Äì my primary machine, a Dell <span class="caps">D820</span> decided to die just before <span class="caps">FOSDEM.</span> This has left me using my Netbook as my main machine. It took me ~15.5hrs to build LibreOffice on&nbsp;it.</p>

      <p>Community Discussion - Part&nbsp;5</p>
    </div>

    <p>Oh yes, I‚Äôm still going at it folks! Let‚Äôs discuss&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>This time round I‚Äôd like us to discuss Collaboration, Learning, Listening and Leading.¬† Let me clarify what I mean by Collaboration; I‚Äôm¬†<strong><span class="caps">NOT</span></strong>¬†talking about Groupwise/Exchange/Zimbra/Alfresco/SharePoint/Kablink style collabortaion, but I¬†<strong><span class="caps">AM</span></strong>¬†talking about working with other parties and&nbsp;teams.</p>

<p>Within open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> as with other distributions there are multiple teams/projects that in some cases could be classed as competitors ‚Äì <span class="caps">GNOME</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">KDE</span> are a prime example.¬† Just because they are trying to get you to use them doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt have some commonality (other than the underlying <span class="caps">OS</span>).¬† I‚Äôd love to see more collaboration with other distributions, working with them on the topic of say <span class="caps">RPM</span> as an example.¬† Working with upstream DEs and other distros to improve the likes of a11y (that‚Äôs accessibility for thos that aren‚Äôt aware, you know ‚Äì audio/visual/etc impaired), education.

Oh yes, I‚Äôm still going at it folks! Let‚Äôs discuss :-)

This time round I‚Äôd like us to discuss Collaboration, Learning, Listening and Leading.¬† Let me clarify what I mean by Collaboration; I‚Äôm¬†**NOT**¬†talking about Groupwise/Exchange/Zimbra/Alfresco/SharePoint/Kablink style collabortaion, but I¬†**AM**¬†talking about working with other parties and teams.

Within openSUSE as with other distributions there are multiple teams/projects that in some cases could be classed as competitors ‚Äì GNOME & KDE are a prime example.¬† Just because they are trying to get you to use them doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt have some commonality (other than the underlying OS).¬† I‚Äôd love to see more collaboration with other distributions, working with them on the topic of say RPM as an example.¬† Working with upstream DEs and other distros to improve the likes of a11y (that‚Äôs accessibility for thos that aren‚Äôt aware, you know ‚Äì audio/visual/etc impaired), education. You get the idea?¬† Quite often we need to just look past our differences and get on with the job, soon we‚Äôll realise (hoipefully) that we are pretty much the same the difference is in the implementation.¬† If we focus locally on how we can collaborate within openSUSE alone then we need to work together with a focused vision and take a demographic, say developers, and get everyone interested to chip in with ways of making it easier and better for developers to use openSUSE.¬† Both KDE and GNOME can easily contribute to this, as can documentation gurus and others.¬† The key here is to have a clearly defined target and work together, effectively combining multiple teams into one.

So what about Learning?¬† Well the most obvious way to learn is from history.¬† I‚Äôm not saying we need to dig up the text books from school and see what Claudius Maximus Aurellius did in ancient Rome, but look at the histroy of openSUSE and see what we did right and crucially what we did wrong.¬† Look at it and see if it still applies today and how we can do it right.¬† Another way of learning is from our competitors and counterparts, the likes of Ubuntu, Fedora and all the other distros and projects do some great work (whether one likes to admit it or not).¬† We need to take note of what/how/why they did and see if it applies to us and could we improve it.¬† I think there is too much of a taboo on emulating what others do, if it works then do it!¬† Why on earth should we re-invent the blessed wheel?

Something that we are getting a bit better at is Listening.¬† We‚Äôre not great at it, but the movement is in the right direction.¬† When listening it‚Äôs best to just slow down a touch and actually take stock of what is being said, also take note of how it is being said.¬† The message could get lost or garbled due to the way it is being passed, and if we don‚Äôt focus on listening we may not notice that little fact and end up not really paying attention to the message, when in fact the message is actually very important or beneficial to us.¬† We need to listen to not just our community but also to those communities that we interact with and indirectly depend on ‚Äì I‚Äôm mostly talking about upstream here.¬† There‚Äôs a lot of passive learning to be had from just listening ;-)

When it comes to being a Lead, you don‚Äôt have to be a nominated by committee or anything ‚Äì grab the bull by the cahunas and run with it! Go with your instinct, unless you are a complete loonie you will have some reasonable rationale for doing whatever it is and can easily explain to others why/what you are doing.¬† Don‚Äôt be scared, empower yourself and show others that what you‚Äôre doing is cool and actually benefits us.

So does anyone have any examples of where we could benefit by collaborating?¬† Or what about how we can improve on the instances where we are already collaborating?¬† What about examples of lessons to be learned from?¬† Yes this could get political and charged, but remember stay calm and focused ‚Äì it‚Äôs easier for people to pay attention that way ;-)¬† How about listening, any examples of where we failed or where we actually got it?¬† I‚Äôd also like to see who you think show good leadership, and also how/why.¬† This isn‚Äôt about who you‚Äôd like to see as the next Chairperson for the board or what ever but people that have grabbed those cahunas and run to the finish line.

There is one item that is constant throughout ‚Äì focus!¬† If we stay focused then we can do almost anything, even by me a drink :-);T;

    <div class="title">
      <p>Goblin - Then, Now <span class="amp">&amp;</span> the&nbsp;Future</p>
    </div>

    <p>It‚Äôs been a while since I mentioned anything about Goblin and anything netbook related, sorry. ¬†Anyhow as everyone is aware, Moblin has since been superseded by MeeGo. ¬†The timing was a bit of a <span class="caps">PITA</span> for me, as it coincided with the Factory freeze, which means I couldn‚Äôt update the relevant packages etc in-time for&nbsp;<span class="caps">11.3.</span></p>

<p>As it stands, <span class="caps">11.3</span> should have an almost fully functional Moblin environment ‚Äì I say ‚Äòalmost‚Äô as there were two packages that I just couldn‚Äôt get to co-operate and build (the modified Moblin browser, and the Web panel). ¬†They should not affect your enjoyment of the <span class="caps">UX</span> so I‚Äôm not going to kick myself too hard. ¬† I have learnt several lessons though trying to get Moblin into&nbsp;Factory:</p>

<ul>
<li>1:¬†Getting things into the next distro release is¬†<strong><span class="caps">NOT</span></strong>¬†difficult.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, the process is very simple and straight forward. ¬†Importantly, there is a huge amount of help from all parties that deal with the acceptance etc. ¬†If you need help or guidance, just ask! I can‚Äôt stress enough how much help is available to people. ¬†I would personally like to thank everyone that helped, but I know I will miss some people off due to my feeble brain. ¬†As a start these people have been invaluable to the process ‚Äì Andreas Jaeger, Marcus Ruckert, Stephan Kulow, Michael Meeks, Henne Vogelsang, Pascal Blesser, Andrea Florio <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Dominique Luerenberger. ¬†Thank you all (and sorry to those whom I missed of&nbsp;listing).</p>

<ul>
<li>2:¬†You need to plan, and plan&nbsp;well.</li>
</ul>

<p>I started off with great intentions, but I didn‚Äôt take into account how disruptive my daytime job would be. ¬†Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt wopn the lottery and as such I have to deal with ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù, otherwise I have no food or house :-(¬†Part of my bad planning led to me missing the cut-off for getting Moblin listed as an installable option from the get&nbsp;go.</p>

<ul>
<li>3:¬†Spread the&nbsp;love.</li>
</ul>

<p>There‚Äôs a saying I‚Äôve heard many times and from many different places ‚Äì A burden shared is a burden eased. ¬†Do you know what? ¬†It‚Äôs absolutely true! ¬†Even if there are only a couple of you dealing with a project, it makes things so much easier, and having more is just plain fun :-) ¬†I tried to get some of you reprobates to join in, but you were all too busy. ¬†As such the pace of progress was fairly&nbsp;slow.</p>

<ul>
<li>4.¬†Have fun doing&nbsp;it.</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to almost anything you do, but especially when doing any form of contribution. If you feel that it is getting you down, take a break, try and pass the baton to someone else to carry it forward for a bit. ¬†What ever you do, don‚Äôt let it burn you out! ¬†Loosing a contributor to burn-out is disastrous for the community, and is something we should all be aware of and on the look out&nbsp;for.</p>

;T;	I"*# 

It‚Äôs been a while since I mentioned anything about Goblin and anything netbook related, sorry. ¬†Anyhow as everyone is aware, Moblin has since been superseded by MeeGo. ¬†The timing was a bit of a PITA for me, as it coincided with the Factory freeze, which means I couldn‚Äôt update the relevant packages etc in-time for 11.3.

As it stands, 11.3 should have an almost fully functional Moblin environment ‚Äì I say ‚Äòalmost‚Äô as there were two packages that I just couldn‚Äôt get to co-operate and build (the modified Moblin browser, and the Web panel). ¬†They should not affect your enjoyment of the UX so I‚Äôm not going to kick myself too hard. ¬† I have learnt several lessons though trying to get Moblin into Factory:

* 1:¬†Getting things into the next distro release is¬†**NOT**¬†difficult.

I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, the process is very simple and straight forward. ¬†Importantly, there is a huge amount of help from all parties that deal with the acceptance etc. ¬†If you need help or guidance, just ask! I can‚Äôt stress enough how much help is available to people. ¬†I would personally like to thank everyone that helped, but I know I will miss some people off due to my feeble brain. ¬†As a start these people have been invaluable to the process ‚Äì Andreas Jaeger, Marcus Ruckert, Stephan Kulow, Michael Meeks, Henne Vogelsang, Pascal Blesser, Andrea Florio & Dominique Luerenberger. ¬†Thank you all (and sorry to those whom I missed of listing).

* 2:¬†You need to plan, and plan well.

I started off with great intentions, but I didn‚Äôt take into account how disruptive my daytime job would be. ¬†Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt wopn the lottery and as such I have to deal with ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù, otherwise I have no food or house :-(¬†Part of my bad planning led to me missing the cut-off for getting Moblin listed as an installable option from the get go.

* 3:¬†Spread the love.

There‚Äôs a saying I‚Äôve heard many times and from many different places ‚Äì A burden shared is a burden eased. ¬†Do you know what? ¬†It‚Äôs absolutely true! ¬†Even if there are only a couple of you dealing with a project, it makes things so much easier, and having more is just plain fun :-) ¬†I tried to get some of you reprobates to join in, but you were all too busy. ¬†As such the pace of progress was fairly slow.

* 4.¬†Have fun doing it.

This applies to almost anything you do, but especially when doing any form of contribution. If you feel that it is getting you down, take a break, try and pass the baton to someone else to carry it forward for a bit. ¬†What ever you do, don‚Äôt let it burn you out! ¬†Loosing a contributor to burn-out is disastrous for the community, and is something we should all be aware of and on the look out for.

So that‚Äôs the past/present, what about the present/future? ¬†Well Goblin will live on, and incorporate all the new goodness that is coming out of MeeGo. ¬†I do genuinely think that MeeGo is a vast improvement on Moblin, but as always there‚Äôs room for improvement; and what better way to start improving than by getting the Geeko involved? :-)¬†As my contribution to HackWeek 5, I have started the importing process for all the MeeGo packages, into the OBS. ¬†Believe it or not, there are only a handful of packages that can be carried over from Moblin which is a bugger. ¬†Regardless I think I have got pretty much all the needed pieces in.

Problem is the way I‚Äôve done it is pretty hacky ‚Äì I basically just ¬†dropped the contents of the SRPMs in and hoped for the best. ¬†This was done mainly for speed, and I know that it isn‚Äôt good enough. ¬†Problem is I‚Äôm trying to balance my regular job and dealing with managing the renovation of my parent‚Äôs house at the same time, so I really don‚Äôt have a huge amount of spare time :-/ ¬†So this is where¬†**YOU**¬†come in.

Please help me to not only get Goblin updated to the latest and greatest that MeeGo has to offer, but also prove to everyone outside of the openSUSE community that we are a coherent and cohesive force to be reckoned with! ¬†Too many people discount us, and just say that without Novell nothing would get done. ¬†Please help me to help you to prove this assumption to be a load of rubbish. ¬†We have the tools and knowledge available to us, so let‚Äôs get on with it and get it done! ¬†Oh and we have the real opportunity to be a leader here ‚Äì the first distro to provide a full MeeGo experience!

So if you can help, then please join in on¬†[IRC][3]¬†(#opensuse-moblin), and on the¬†[mailing list][4]¬†( make sure you are¬†[subscribed][5]¬†first). ¬†The first step is to get everything building, from there we can move forward. ¬†Oh by the way, this initial push is for the Netbook UX, but I‚Äôd love to see use get the Handheld/Tablet UX when that is released ![;-)][6] ¬†I‚Äôm tempted by Garrett‚Äôs name suggestion of Smeegol, but let‚Äôs get it building and working first ;-)

    <div class="title">
      <p>When Geekos with ARMs get&nbsp;together</p>
    </div>

    <p>I‚Äôm here in the belly of the Geeko at <span class="caps">SUSE</span>‚Äôs offices in Nuremberg, due to the fact that the new open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Board" title="The openSUSE Board">Board</a> had their Face to Face meeting yesterday (whole different topic needing its own post ;-) ). As I was coming here I thought it would be prudent to try and get the various people dealing with and interested in the <span class="caps">ARM</span> port around a table at some point to discus the status of things. Yes, I know there are several people missing from the discussion ‚Äì like those in the Prague office, and those not employed at <span class="caps">SUSE</span> ‚Äì but getting everyone together will have to wait until the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Conference later this year :-) . Thanks to Bernhard who cajoled folk, we just finished having a fairly productive&nbsp;meeting.</p>

<p>The intention of the meeting was to try and get some form of milestones agreed, and work out our next moves and find out what tasks etc need to be done. ¬†Several¬†decisions¬†were&nbsp;made:
1. ARMv7 is the focus. This isn‚Äôt necessarily news, but we just wanted to¬†reiterate the message. Also the ARMv5 builds are going to have their priorities in the <span class="caps">OBS</span> lowered to minimise the build power consumption. We‚Äôre not deleting them,¬†¬†just not focusing on them; if someone <strong>really</strong> wants v5 builds then best you roll your sleeves up and get stuck ¬†in, we will provide support, guidance and&nbsp;encouragement.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We are aiming for <span class="caps">12.2</span> to have full <span class="caps">ARM</span> support. So this means we need to freeze in time for <span class="caps">12.2</span> <span class="caps">RC1</span>, so we can not have any build failures. If there are we need to fix them, but some applications are known not to run on <span class="caps">ARM</span>, where these are identified we will just use <code>ExcludeArch: %arm</code>. This needs to be done by 01June2012 at the&nbsp;latest.</p></li>
<li><p>To ensure we can make the deadline we need to make sure that all sources are submitted into Factory via the respective devel projects. This means that we have no source overlays in the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>:Factory:<span class="caps">ARM</span> repo. Also that all hacks and ‚Äúfixes‚Äù are discussed with maintainers and either incorporated or better fixes are submitted. We will <strong><span class="caps">NOT</span></strong> have separate sources or patches for the <span class="caps">ARM</span> port, everything will have to be in&nbsp;Factory.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to have a reference platform that <strong><span class="caps">ALL</span>¬†</strong>developers can use to verify <span class="caps">12.2</span> will work, this will be the Pandaboard. This does not mean we will not be supporting other devices, like Snowball, Beagleboard or Origen; they will be available but they may not have gone through the same¬†rigorous¬†tests. We will also look at having <span class="caps">XFCE</span> as the reference platform Desktop Environment. Now before anyone starts calling for blood, there were some reasons for refernece platform&nbsp;decision:</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>  a.) There are sufficient numbers of Pandaboards for developers to&nbsp;use</li>
<li>  b.) Pandaboard has the best upstream support out of all the&nbsp;devices</li>
<li>  c.) We already have Kiwi based images for&nbsp;it</li>
<li>  d.) <span class="caps">XFCE</span> is the only <span class="caps">DE</span> that builds almost completely and runs at the&nbsp;moment</li>
<li>  e.) <span class="caps">2D</span> graphics work out of the box on the&nbsp;Pandaboard</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>‚Äôs <span class="caps">ARM</span> port has gone on a diet. The Geeko is now FATless, this means we no longer have a¬†separate¬†<span class="caps">FAT</span> partition for the boot file system. All partitions are now ext3 by default, <span class="caps">BTRFS</span> is supported but isn‚Äôt our&nbsp;default.</p></li>
<li><p>The Kiwi generated images will use the <span class="caps">OEM</span> format rather than the Live Install format. Basically this means that a user will <code>dd</code> the image to the target <span class="caps">SD</span> card and then the ‚Äúsecond boot‚Äù process will kick in when a user boots from the card so that they can configure passwords/network/etc and it will repartition to take up the whole of the&nbsp;card.</p></li>
<li><p>Bernhard is going to look at integrating <span class="caps">ARM</span> support into <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/" title="Q&amp;A in the open">Open<span class="caps">QA</span></a>. This means we can get advance notice of breakages etc. prior to releasing&nbsp;images.</p></li>
<li><p>We will be triggering a rebuild of the <span class="caps">ARM</span> repo to ensure that builds take into account some of the big changes that have happened in Factory (like the Xorg changes), and also to clean out any ‚Äúfixes‚Äù that were applied to the repo. This will most likely be initiated in batches rather than the complete repo, hopefully we can avoid the repo being out of¬†commission¬†for four weeks this&nbsp;way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Another outcome of the meeting was working out some tasks that needed to be completed. There aren‚Äôt that many tasks and they are open to <strong><span class="caps">EVERYONE</span></strong> to help out&nbsp;with: 
* I.) We need to keep a closer eye on the package failures. Using Dirk‚Äôs <a href="http://www.suse.de/%7Edmueller/arm-buildservice/" title="Compare Native/Qemu/IBS/OBS builds">Build Comparison page</a> will help to isolate failures due to qemu. All qemu¬†bugs/issues need to be passed on to either Alexander Graf (agraf) or Andreas Farber (afarber) for&nbsp;fixing.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="caps">II.</span>) We need to look at Ya<span class="caps">ST</span>‚Äôs second stage module and see if that will be of use to the <span class="caps">ARM</span>&nbsp;port.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="caps">III.</span>) We really need to re-work the wiki for the <span class="caps">ARM</span> port. It needs to be much more detailed as it hasn‚Äôt been updated in a&nbsp;while.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So that gives us three months or 12 weeks to get our house in order. If you want to see open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> get a decent release on <span class="caps">ARM</span>, then join in and help out!! You don‚Äôt need to know packaging/architecture/code to help, jump on <span class="caps">IRC</span> (#opensuse-arm on Freenode) or send a mail to the mailing list (opensuse-arm make sure you subscribe first) and ask questions and get your hands dirty&nbsp;;-)</p>

I‚Äôm here in the belly of the Geeko at SUSE‚Äôs offices in Nuremberg, due to the fact that the new openSUSE [Board][1] had their Face to Face meeting yesterday (whole different topic needing its own post ;-) ). As I was coming here I thought it would be prudent to try and get the various people dealing with and interested in the ARM port around a table at some point to discus the status of things. Yes, I know there are several people missing from the discussion ‚Äì like those in the Prague office, and those not employed at SUSE ‚Äì but getting everyone together will have to wait until the openSUSE Conference later this year :-) . Thanks to Bernhard who cajoled folk, we just finished having a fairly productive meeting.

We will also look at having XFCE as the reference platform Desktop Environment. Now before anyone starts calling for blood, there were some reasons for refernece platform decision:

*   a.) There are sufficient numbers of Pandaboards for developers to use
*   b.) Pandaboard has the best upstream support out of all the devices
*   c.) We already have Kiwi based images for it
*   d.) XFCE is the only DE that builds almost completely and runs at the moment
*   e.) 2D graphics work out of the box on the Pandaboard

5. openSUSE‚Äôs ARM port has gone on a diet. The Geeko is now FATless, this means we no longer have a¬†separate¬†FAT partition for the boot file system. All partitions are now ext3 by default, BTRFS is supported but isn‚Äôt our default.

6. The Kiwi generated images will use the OEM format rather than the Live Install format. Basically this means that a user will `dd` the image to the target SD card and then the ‚Äúsecond boot‚Äù process will kick in when a user boots from the card so that they can configure passwords/network/etc and it will repartition to take up the whole of the card.

7. Bernhard is going to look at integrating ARM support into [OpenQA][4]. This means we can get advance notice of breakages etc. prior to releasing images.

8. We will be triggering a rebuild of the ARM repo to ensure that builds take into account some of the big changes that have happened in Factory (like the Xorg changes), and also to clean out any ‚Äúfixes‚Äù that were applied to the repo. This will most likely be initiated in batches rather than the complete repo, hopefully we can avoid the repo being out of¬†commission¬†for four weeks this way.

Another outcome of the meeting was working out some tasks that needed to be completed. There aren‚Äôt that many tasks and they are open to **EVERYONE** to help out with: 
* I.) We need to keep a closer eye on the package failures. Using Dirk‚Äôs [Build Comparison page][5] will help to isolate failures due to qemu. All qemu¬†bugs/issues need to be passed on to either Alexander Graf (agraf) or Andreas Farber (afarber) for fixing.

 [5]: http://www.suse.de/~dmueller/arm-buildservice/ "Compare Native/Qemu/IBS/OBS builds"

* II.) We need to look at YaST‚Äôs second stage module and see if that will be of use to the ARM port.

* III.) We really need to re-work the wiki for the ARM port. It needs to be much more detailed as it hasn‚Äôt been updated in a while.

So that gives us three months or 12 weeks to get our house in order. If you want to see openSUSE get a decent release on ARM, then join in and help out!! You don‚Äôt need to know packaging/architecture/code to help, jump on IRC (#opensuse-arm on Freenode) or send a mail to the mailing list (opensuse-arm make sure you subscribe first) and ask questions and get your hands dirty ;-);T;
I"9<p>I‚Äôm here in the belly of the Geeko at SUSE‚Äôs offices in Nuremberg, due to the fact that the new openSUSE <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Board" title="The openSUSE Board">Board</a> had their Face to Face meeting yesterday (whole different topic needing its own post ;-) ). As I was coming here I thought it would be prudent to try and get the various people dealing with and interested in the ARM port around a table at some point to discus the status of things. Yes, I know there are several people missing from the discussion ‚Äì like those in the Prague office, and those not employed at SUSE ‚Äì but getting everyone together will have to wait until the openSUSE Conference later this year :-) . Thanks to Bernhard who cajoled folk, we just finished having a fairly productive meeting.</p>

<p>The intention of the meeting was to try and get some form of milestones agreed, and work out our next moves and find out what tasks etc need to be done. ¬†Several¬†decisions¬†were made:
1. ARMv7 is the focus. This isn‚Äôt necessarily news, but we just wanted to¬†reiterate the message. Also the ARMv5 builds are going to have their priorities in the OBS lowered to minimise the build power consumption. We‚Äôre not deleting them,¬†¬†just not focusing on them; if someone <strong>really</strong> wants v5 builds then best you roll your sleeves up and get stuck ¬†in, we will provide support, guidance and encouragement.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We are aiming for 12.2 to have full ARM support. So this means we need to freeze in time for 12.2 RC1, so we can not have any build failures. If there are we need to fix them, but some applications are known not to run on ARM, where these are identified we will just use <code>ExcludeArch: %arm</code>. This needs to be done by 01June2012 at the latest.</p></li>
<li><p>To ensure we can make the deadline we need to make sure that all sources are submitted into Factory via the respective devel projects. This means that we have no source overlays in the openSUSE:Factory:ARM repo. Also that all hacks and ‚Äúfixes‚Äù are discussed with maintainers and either incorporated or better fixes are submitted. We will <strong>NOT</strong> have separate sources or patches for the ARM port, everything will have to be in Factory.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to have a reference platform that <strong>ALL¬†</strong>developers can use to verify 12.2 will work, this will be the Pandaboard. This does not mean we will not be supporting other devices, like Snowball, Beagleboard or Origen; they will be available but they may not have gone through the same¬†rigorous¬†tests.

So word from the new Big Cheese, Herr Braukmann, is openSUSE is vital to SUSE ‚Äì newsflash, this isn‚Äôt new or surprising ;-) In the same breath SUSE is vital for openSUSE, again nothing new here.

    <div class="title">
      <p>The week that was o<span class="caps">SC</span>&nbsp;11</p>
    </div>

    <p>Unfortunately the good times have come to an end, one of the best shindig in a long time has been and gone. Friends from far away have returned home, as have&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>Yes, the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Conference of 2011 was an absolute blast. Seriously, I had an absolute scream. As I mentioned¬†<a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/08/30/what-the-opensuse-conference-means-to-me.html" title="What the openSUSE Conference means to me">before</a>¬†I was expecting a whole heap of fun, and boy did the Geeko&nbsp;deliver!!!</p>

<p>I met up with all sorts of people, starting off with Richard Brown a.k.a. Ilmehtar at Gatwick airport (I didn‚Äôt actually realised that Richard was Ilmehtar until about day 1 or 2 of the conference), oh and Michael Meeks. We pitched up at the hotel, checked in, dumped our bags and went straight to the venue to help sort stuff&nbsp;out.</p>

<p>Well, we didn‚Äôt have to do much sorting out as those Thirsty Thirteen (you may know them as the Fabulous Booster Boys) had turned the derilect building into a fantastic conference venue. Not entirely on their own, they did have some help from a bunch of Greeks, some Swiss and some stray Brazilian (love you Izabel ;-)&nbsp;).</p>

<p>Whilst catching up with some of the folk that were there on the Saturday, I got one of the best surprises that the Geeko could give me ‚Äì I met up with a bunch of guys from Taiwan. Why would meeting a bunch of Taiwanese be so cool? Simples! These were some of the super heros that helped me fix, patch, kick and roll out Smeegol. With out their help and encouragement I doubt I would have survived. They are a cool and crazy ¬†bunch of guys, and I am¬†<strong><span class="caps">SO</span>¬†</strong>happy to have met them in the&nbsp;flesh.</p>

<p>Another great thing about the conference was the crate load of Old Toad, open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>‚Äôs own beer. Not only did I drink plenty, but *everyone* drank plenty. The beer wasn‚Äôt given away, near enough but not quite ‚Äì each beer was ‚Ç¨1 which goes back into the geeko bank to help finance future community efforts. I‚Äôve no idea on how much was generated but I‚Äôm confident that we smashed through a four figure sum :-) The only touristy thing I did this year was take a little tour with Uncle Klaas (dragotin to his fellow geekos), and about 20 or so other like minded thirsty Geekos. Uncle Klaas took us to the home of Old Toad, and got us a tour of the lovely little brewery that helped make the fine beverage. We sampled some fine beers (yes Pascal, they were actually pretty good even in comparison to the holy belgian fluid ;-) ), followed by some great food and as always we had excellent&nbsp;company.</p>

<p>The conference itself had some good talks, some of them were very technical, some of them struck a good balance, and others were totally non-technical ‚Äì all in all a great mix, something for everyone. I‚Äôd just like to thank all the <span class="caps">SUSE</span> Labs guys and gals for joining us and making it one big happy family ![:-)][3] I‚Äôve always thought of the Labs folk as kind of ‚ÄòBlack Ops‚Äô sorta people, you know the type ‚Äì ‚Äúoh I could tell you what I do but then I‚Äôd have to kill you‚Äù. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Well, not¬†<em>that</em>¬†close at least :-P ¬†Sure they‚Äôre clever peeps, but they‚Äôre also very human and lovers of all Geekos. Next time you see one of them, take a leaf out of Jos‚Äô or Pavol‚Äôs book and give them a hug ‚Äì you may need to ask first as they may think you‚Äôre trying to steal their latest crazy idea&nbsp;;-)</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs see did I forget any other fun bits? Oh, I did indeed. There was the Conference evening party, where we had a fine specimen of a beast (sorry Henne but that mechanical bull was hawt!!). The outside seating area was partially transformed into a Western style ranch with poker tables, and yes a mechanical bull ‚Äì I believe the night‚Äôs record was for 71seconds or so. The food was great, and I‚Äôd like to thank the local butcher/caterers for some great&nbsp;grub.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs not all, I also had the pleasure of attending Michael Willmer‚Äôs keynote. For those that don‚Äôt know Michael is the ‚Äò<span class="caps">VP</span> of Marketing and Global Alliances‚Äô at <span class="caps">SUSE.</span> He‚Äôs an Attachmate veteran, and he‚Äôs a suit.<strong><span class="caps">BUT</span>‚Ä¶¬†</strong>And it‚Äôs a pretty huge but. He‚Äôs no ordinary suit, seriously. This is not properganda, it‚Äôs not marketing fluff. It is my own personal take on things. For a senior suit, the man turned up wearing his open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> t-shirt. He fired up his laptop and low and behold he‚Äôs running <span class="caps">GNOME</span>-shell, sure it was in fallback mode but he is clearly not scared of cuts and bruises from software. He started his presentation and oh look, he‚Äôs not using <span class="caps">LO</span> or any other presentation software, no <span class="caps">PDF.</span> He created his presentation in Inkscape with the Sozi plugin, and used Chromium as the actual tool to display it all. Just to remind you, Michael Miller is a senior suit at a large <span class="caps">US</span> corporation, yeah it‚Äôs kinda tough to connect the two but this is the one and the same. He mingled with the crowd of Geekos afterwards and came back the next day for more Geeko love ‚Äì oh and the obligatory ear bending from some people (not me, honest). I‚Äôm sure the roses will fade, but I‚Äôm quietly confident that there will be more positive than negative from now on. I‚Äôm not saying there wont be any rubbish, there will always be rubbish, just that the amount will be less and how it is handled will hopefully be&nbsp;better.</p>

<p>Yes, I thoroughly loved the conference this year. It was genuinely open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>‚Äôs conference as the hard work was done by open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> not by corporate drones. ¬†Nothing was dictated, it was decided. I seriously can‚Äôt thank the Boosters enough for their hard physical labour. I‚Äôd also like to thank the conference teams, like those accepting submissions for sessions and the travel sponsorship committee. Also I‚Äôd also like to thank Alexia for tirelessly manning the bar dealing with weird reprobates. I‚Äôd like to thank Jillian and Katie for interpreting for Bryen. These two women aren‚Äôt technical, although they kind of know some of the jargon and acronyms, they didn‚Äôt really understand what they meant.

;T;	I"[# 

Unfortunately the good times have come to an end, one of the best shindig in a long time has been and gone. Friends from far away have returned home, as have I.

Yes, the openSUSE Conference of 2011 was an absolute blast. Seriously, I had an absolute scream. As I mentioned¬†[before][1]¬†I was expecting a whole heap of fun, and boy did the Geeko deliver!!!

 [1]: http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/08/30/what-the-opensuse-conference-means-to-me.html "What the openSUSE Conference means to me"

I met up with all sorts of people, starting off with Richard Brown a.k.a. Ilmehtar at Gatwick airport (I didn‚Äôt actually realised that Richard was Ilmehtar until about day 1 or 2 of the conference), oh and Michael Meeks. We pitched up at the hotel, checked in, dumped our bags and went straight to the venue to help sort stuff out.

Well, we didn‚Äôt have to do much sorting out as those Thirsty Thirteen (you may know them as the Fabulous Booster Boys) had turned the derilect building into a fantastic conference venue. Not entirely on their own, they did have some help from a bunch of Greeks, some Swiss and some stray Brazilian (love you Izabel ;-) ).

Whilst catching up with some of the folk that were there on the Saturday, I got one of the best surprises that the Geeko could give me ‚Äì I met up with a bunch of guys from Taiwan. Why would meeting a bunch of Taiwanese be so cool? Simples! These were some of the super heros that helped me fix, patch, kick and roll out Smeegol. With out their help and encouragement I doubt I would have survived. They are a cool and crazy ¬†bunch of guys, and I am¬†**SO¬†**happy to have met them in the flesh.

Another great thing about the conference was the crate load of Old Toad, openSUSE‚Äôs own beer. Not only did I drink plenty, but \*everyone\* drank plenty. The beer wasn‚Äôt given away, near enough but not quite ‚Äì each beer was ‚Ç¨1 which goes back into the geeko bank to help finance future community efforts. I‚Äôve no idea on how much was generated but I‚Äôm confident that we smashed through a four figure sum :-) The only touristy thing I did this year was take a little tour with Uncle Klaas (dragotin to his fellow geekos), and about 20 or so other like minded thirsty Geekos. Uncle Klaas took us to the home of Old Toad, and got us a tour of the lovely little brewery that helped make the fine beverage. We sampled some fine beers (yes Pascal, they were actually pretty good even in comparison to the holy belgian fluid ;-) ), followed by some great food and as always we had excellent company.

The conference itself had some good talks, some of them were very technical, some of them struck a good balance, and others were totally non-technical ‚Äì all in all a great mix, something for everyone. I‚Äôd just like to thank all the SUSE Labs guys and gals for joining us and making it one big happy family ![:-)][3] I‚Äôve always thought of the Labs folk as kind of ‚ÄòBlack Ops‚Äô sorta people, you know the type ‚Äì ‚Äúoh I could tell you what I do but then I‚Äôd have to kill you‚Äù. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Well, not¬†*that*¬†close at least :-P ¬†Sure they‚Äôre clever peeps, but they‚Äôre also very human and lovers of all Geekos. Next time you see one of them, take a leaf out of Jos‚Äô or Pavol‚Äôs book and give them a hug ‚Äì you may need to ask first as they may think you‚Äôre trying to steal their latest crazy idea ;-)

Let‚Äôs see did I forget any other fun bits? Oh, I did indeed. There was the Conference evening party, where we had a fine specimen of a beast (sorry Henne but that mechanical bull was hawt!!). The outside seating area was partially transformed into a Western style ranch with poker tables, and yes a mechanical bull ‚Äì I believe the night‚Äôs record was for 71seconds or so. The food was great, and I‚Äôd like to thank the local butcher/caterers for some great grub.

That‚Äôs not all, I also had the pleasure of attending Michael Willmer‚Äôs keynote. For those that don‚Äôt know Michael is the ‚ÄòVP of Marketing and Global Alliances‚Äô at SUSE. He‚Äôs an Attachmate veteran, and he‚Äôs a suit.**BUT‚Ä¶¬†**And it‚Äôs a pretty huge but. He‚Äôs no ordinary suit, seriously. This is not properganda, it‚Äôs not marketing fluff. It is my own personal take on things. For a senior suit, the man turned up wearing his openSUSE t-shirt. He fired up his laptop and low and behold he‚Äôs running GNOME-shell, sure it was in fallback mode but he is clearly not scared of cuts and bruises from software. He started his presentation and oh look, he‚Äôs not using LO or any other presentation software, no PDF. He created his presentation in Inkscape with the Sozi plugin, and used Chromium as the actual tool to display it all. Just to remind you, Michael Miller is a senior suit at a large US corporation, yeah it‚Äôs kinda tough to connect the two but this is the one and the same. He mingled with the crowd of Geekos afterwards and came back the next day for more Geeko love ‚Äì oh and the obligatory ear bending from some people (not me, honest). I‚Äôm sure the roses will fade, but I‚Äôm quietly confident that there will be more positive than negative from now on. I‚Äôm not saying there wont be any rubbish, there will always be rubbish, just that the amount will be less and how it is handled will hopefully be better.

Yes, I thoroughly loved the conference this year. It was genuinely openSUSE‚Äôs conference as the hard work was done by openSUSE not by corporate drones. ¬†Nothing was dictated, it was decided. I seriously can‚Äôt thank the Boosters enough for their hard physical labour. I‚Äôd also like to thank the conference teams, like those accepting submissions for sessions and the travel sponsorship committee. Also I‚Äôd also like to thank Alexia for tirelessly manning the bar dealing with weird reprobates. I‚Äôd like to thank Jillian and Katie for interpreting for Bryen. These two women aren‚Äôt technical, although they kind of know some of the jargon and acronyms, they didn‚Äôt really understand what they meant. Never the less the did a fine job in interpreting all the Geeko love for Bryen to fully enjoy. Oh and Coolo learnt a new thing from them too :-)

I could end my ramblings on a high, but that wouldn‚Äôt be cricket now ;-) So what was wrong? The simplest thing -¬†**PRINT PEOPLE‚ÄôS IRC NICKNAMES WITH THEIR NAMES ON THE BADGES!!!¬†** Seriosuly, this is something that has been asked for at each conference. Kindly do it for the next one, please. That‚Äôs an easy fix, the next one isn‚Äôt so easy. We have a great and vibrant community. we have lots of clever people (yes, we do also have some stupid people), problem is we don‚Äôt interact well with speakers and presenters. Seriously, we suck in that respect. I‚Äôm not saying I want to see and hear hecklers at the next conference, but if a presenter asks for audience participation bloddy well participate!!!!!

      <p>open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> on <span class="caps">ARM</span> Update&nbsp;310112</p>
    </div>

    <p>It‚Äôs been a little over a month since the last update and as always there has been progress :-) First let‚Äôs get some of the numbers out of the way, currently we have 4202 packages built successfully, with 120 failed which is leading to 582 unresolvable. Remember this is for a full open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Factory (<span class="caps">12.2</span>) build. Not bad, but we still have a way to go if we want to have an <span class="caps">ARM</span> port ready for <span class="caps">12.2</span>‚Ä≤s release ‚Äì yes that is our hope and intention. Some of those packages that have built successfully still need tweaking, as an example mkinitrd and&nbsp;perl-Bootloader.</p>

<p>There has also been a change to the internal native build farm. This was what had been set up with the sponsored hardware to do a parralel build of Factory to verify that <span class="caps">QEMU</span> was indeed doing the job properly. It was previously setup using an development <span class="caps">OBS</span> instance for speed and as a proof of concept really. The internal native <span class="caps">ARM</span> build farm has now been moved to the <span class="caps">IBS</span>, this is the internal production instance that is used to many of <span class="caps">SUSE</span>‚Äôs products. One of the advantages is that is has very good performance including uptime and is pretty stable compared to the sometimes unstable development instance that was&nbsp;used.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this move to be made possible is that the team working on the <span class="caps">ARM</span> port have been able to sufficiently show that it is possible to build almost the complete distro for the <span class="caps">ARM</span> architecture and that it is maintainable. It is still <strong><em><span class="caps">NOT</span></em></strong> an official port and as such there is no commitment to make it an official product, but (yes there‚Äôs always a but :-) ) it is a good showing that we are sufficiently advanced and that there is little holding us back, including dropping the many dirty hacks that were put in place to get things&nbsp;going.</p>

<p>Other than the uptime and performance advantage, moving to <span class="caps">IBS</span> also allows other interested developers within <span class="caps">SUSE</span>‚Äôs network to quickly check out builds, submit patches or debug things on native hardware. It is still requested that submissions are made against the delopment projects within <span class="caps">OBS</span> but this way people can test there submissions before they get pushed&nbsp;out.</p>

<p>Another of the advancements since last time is that we now have working Kiwi based images for both the Pandaboard and Efika <span class="caps">MX</span> Smartbooks/Smarttops. The Efika images even have working graphics and sound o/ We are still working on ironing out the build failures which will clear the unresolvable backlog slowly but surely. there will still be some packages that need deeper fixes, but they shall be&nbsp;conquered.</p>

<p>It isn‚Äôt all rosey though, that would be boring. Several things are still outstanding (apart from fixing packages), we still have no integration with the distribution and there are plenty of issues with hardware-near items, so we have plenty of work to do. Saying that though there are more people joining in the fray using not only hardware that we have but also using their own <span class="caps">ARM</span> hardware to get some of the latter fixed. Part of the issue with hardware-near components is the state of the <span class="caps">ARM</span> kernel, each SoC still needs its own kernel until Device Tree is ready. So we don‚Äôt plan on sitting back and sleeping, but more help is always welcome&nbsp;;-)</p>

<p>To enable wider access to building on <span class="caps">ARM</span> there are several initiatives underway, one of them is to wait for the new Cortex-<span class="caps">A15</span> based SoCs which will have full hardware support for the likes of <span class="caps">KVM</span>; but that‚Äôs still a few months away before the first boards are available so other options are being investigated. Once something has been found and works hopefully we can have native arm builds on the <span class="caps">OBS</span>, but as I said that is still on the horizon and is a mid term goal at the&nbsp;earliest.</p>

<p>Much of this would not have been possible without the very kind sponsorship of devices from Genesi, Pandaboard.org/Texas Instruments, <span class="caps">ARM</span> and the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community. Also the hard work of the many members of our community; I‚Äôm going to try and name a few here and it is by no means an exhaustive list of people ‚Äì Alex Graf, Adrian Schroeter, Dirk Muller, Marcus Schaefer, Bernhard Wiedemann, Michal Hruseky, Joop Boonen, Andreas Farber, Reinhard Max, Uli Hecht, Matthias Eckermann, Torsten Duwe and Tomas Cech. We have also had a load of help from engineers of Genesi themselves, <span class="caps">ST</span>-Ericsson, Linaro and also we would not have been able to get so far without much of the work that Ubuntu, Mer and Fedora have done. On behalf of the wider open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Community, thank you to all of&nbsp;you!</p>

      <p>Community Discussion - Part&nbsp;2</p>
    </div>

    <p>It‚Äôs been a couple of weeks since my¬†<a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/03/09/community-discussion-part1.html" title="Community Discussion - Part 1">first Discussion with the Community</a>, so as a follow on I thought I would cover the topic of Tools for the community.¬† In my mind I split tools into two groups ‚Äì hard <span class="amp">&amp;</span> soft.¬† What I mean by this is ‚Äúhard‚Äù = infrastructure based, and ‚Äúsoft‚Äù = software&nbsp;based.</p>

<p>Some may seem pretty obvious to you, and some may seem like they aren‚Äôt tools at all.¬† So to clarify what my definition of a tool is ‚Äì something that enables or facilitates the completion of a task.¬† So that gives the ‚ÄúTool‚Äù a pretty big scope&nbsp;:-) </p>

<p>Now as a community we have a lot of good tools already available to us.¬† One of the problems is that we don‚Äôt really know about them or we‚Äôve forgotten about them.¬† So as a refresher here are the ‚Äúhard‚Äù tools (no childish snickering please ;-) ) I can think of, if you notice any that I‚Äôve missed out please let me&nbsp;know:</p>

<li>  <a href="http://opensuse.blip.tv/" title="See presentations etc from the openSUSE community">Video</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a good mix of tools hosted on Novell infrastructure and that hosted outside of Novell.¬† For instance the Source code is actually on the Gitorious service, why should we have to maintain our own <span class="caps">DVCS</span> when there are open services available?¬† Also with the Video, we use Blip.tv and will also add YouTube to the toolset for distribution of open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> video.¬† The Planet is hosted on a community owned and run server as is the Community Wiki and package search.¬† So you can‚Äôt say we are wholly reliant on Novell&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>At the moment I don‚Äôt see anything that we‚Äôre missing, but I‚Äôm sure something will crop up and then we‚Äôll go ‚ÄúAh if only we had <span class="caps">XYZ</span>‚Äù, but when that happens we can look and see what best fits the bill and try and fix it.¬† The only complaint I think we have is that the integration between the tools isn‚Äôt as good as it could or should be.¬† This is something that has been picked up on so don‚Äôt worry too much, the Boosters are working hard to make things blend naturally.¬† So it will happen, just not over&nbsp;night.</p>

<p>Okay so that covers the infrastructure bits, what about the software side of things?¬† Well whilst at the Novell offices in Nurenberg for HackWee<span class="caps">KII</span>, there was a discussion about how to get more people involved in the actual coding of things.¬† Some of the Novellians were curious as to why no-one was willing to actually pick up some of the code and start sending in patches.¬† Well I‚Äôd like to recommend we look at another big project at Novell, and also to some of the big upstream&nbsp;projects.</p>

<p>Firstly the other project is the Mono Project, those that want to spout holier than thou rubbish can just <span class="caps">STFU</span> and do that now!¬† The Mono guys <span class="amp">&amp;</span> gals have made¬†<a href="http://http//www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html" title="Get the latest Mono goodness">available</a>¬†Virtual Machine images, Live CDs, as well as the required packages.¬† They include all the required tools to develop with Mono, and also exmple applications and also code so that you can get going real fast.¬† They have effectivly created a Mono Developer‚Äôs Kit, but crucially they use open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> and they do a fantastic job of pimping the Geeko! Thanks Mono Project, you‚Äôre doing a sterling&nbsp;job!</p>

<p>Secondly we have recently seen that <span class="caps">KDE</span> have created their¬†<a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2010/03/plasma-netbook-reference-platform_15.html" title="Aaron Siego announcing the Plasma Netbook Reference Platform">Plasma Netbook Reference Platform</a>¬†using open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> &amp; our tools, so if anyone wants to look at, tinker with, hack, or do whatever with it they can and easily.¬† <span class="caps">GNOME</span> have a¬†<a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDeveloperKit" title="The GNOME Developer Kit">Developer Kit</a>¬†available thanks to the fine Foresight folks (with a whole lot of love from¬†<a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/" title="THE Foresight &amp; rPath man">Og Maciel</a>).¬† It gives everything one needs to get to developing for the <span class="caps">GNOME</span> Environment.¬† Og has also taken the step and started to create a¬†<a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=828" title="Og's Django Developer Kit">Developer Kit for Django</a>.</p>

<p>So my little mind is starting to tick, and this to those that know me well is always slightly dangerous :-) ¬† Why don‚Äôt we follow these examples, and provide language and function specific developer kits?¬† Prove to people that it isn‚Äôt difficult to make the switch to develop for their preferred language or what ever on open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>, give them Live <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Installable ISOs, give them <span class="caps">VM</span> images. Give them the tools needed to get the job&nbsp;done!</p>

<p>We could always pimp these developer kits at the specific language conferences like PyCon, RailsConf&nbsp;etc.</p>

<p>We have many programming experts within the community, so why don‚Äôt we pull from that expertise?¬† Let‚Äôs get open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Developer kits for Java, Python, Qt, Python, Ruby, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, and any other language you think is beneficial.¬† This isn‚Äôt about what language is better than the next, it is about getting the message out and showing everyone that it really isnt hard to use open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> as your preferred&nbsp;platform.</p>

<p>So now that I‚Äôve said my piece, what tools do people think we are missing?¬† Also what issues do people have with our current tool set?¬† For goodness sake don‚Äôt just grumble about things let‚Äôs discuss constructively so we can fix&nbsp;things!</p>

<p>A bad workman always blames his tools, a good workman utilises his tools to their full&nbsp;extent.</p>

It‚Äôs been a couple of weeks since my¬†[first Discussion with the Community][1], so as a follow on I thought I would cover the topic of Tools for the community.¬† In my mind I split tools into two groups ‚Äì hard & soft.¬† What I mean by this is ‚Äúhard‚Äù = infrastructure based, and ‚Äúsoft‚Äù = software based.

Some may seem pretty obvious to you, and some may seem like they aren‚Äôt tools at all.¬† So to clarify what my definition of a tool is ‚Äì something that enables or facilitates the completion of a task.¬† So that gives the ‚ÄúTool‚Äù a pretty big scope :-) 

Now as a community we have a lot of good tools already available to us.¬† One of the problems is that we don‚Äôt really know about them or we‚Äôve forgotten about them.¬† So as a refresher here are the ‚Äúhard‚Äù tools (no childish snickering please ;-) ) I can think of, if you notice any that I‚Äôve missed out please let me know:

There is a good mix of tools hosted on Novell infrastructure and that hosted outside of Novell.¬† For instance the Source code is actually on the Gitorious service, why should we have to maintain our own DVCS when there are open services available?¬† Also with the Video, we use Blip.tv and will also add YouTube to the toolset for distribution of openSUSE video.¬† The Planet is hosted on a community owned and run server as is the Community Wiki and package search.¬† So you can‚Äôt say we are wholly reliant on Novell :-)

At the moment I don‚Äôt see anything that we‚Äôre missing, but I‚Äôm sure something will crop up and then we‚Äôll go ‚ÄúAh if only we had XYZ‚Äù, but when that happens we can look and see what best fits the bill and try and fix it.¬† The only complaint I think we have is that the integration between the tools isn‚Äôt as good as it could or should be.¬† This is something that has been picked up on so don‚Äôt worry too much, the Boosters are working hard to make things blend naturally.¬† So it will happen, just not over night.

Okay so that covers the infrastructure bits, what about the software side of things?¬† Well whilst at the Novell offices in Nurenberg for HackWeeKII, there was a discussion about how to get more people involved in the actual coding of things.¬† Some of the Novellians were curious as to why no-one was willing to actually pick up some of the code and start sending in patches.¬† Well I‚Äôd like to recommend we look at another big project at Novell, and also to some of the big upstream projects.

Firstly the other project is the Mono Project, those that want to spout holier than thou rubbish can just STFU and do that now!¬† The Mono guys & gals have made¬†[available][28]¬†Virtual Machine images, Live CDs, as well as the required packages.¬† They include all the required tools to develop with Mono, and also exmple applications and also code so that you can get going real fast.¬† They have effectivly created a Mono Developer‚Äôs Kit, but crucially they use openSUSE and they do a fantastic job of pimping the Geeko! Thanks Mono Project, you‚Äôre doing a sterling job!

 [28]: http://http//www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html "Get the latest Mono goodness"

Secondly we have recently seen that KDE have created their¬†[Plasma Netbook Reference Platform][29]¬†using openSUSE & our tools, so if anyone wants to look at, tinker with, hack, or do whatever with it they can and easily.¬† GNOME have a¬†[Developer Kit][30]¬†available thanks to the fine Foresight folks (with a whole lot of love from¬†[Og Maciel][31]).¬† It gives everything one needs to get to developing for the GNOME Environment.¬† Og has also taken the step and started to create a¬†[Developer Kit for Django][32].

So my little mind is starting to tick, and this to those that know me well is always slightly dangerous :-) ¬† Why don‚Äôt we follow these examples, and provide language and function specific developer kits?¬† Prove to people that it isn‚Äôt difficult to make the switch to develop for their preferred language or what ever on openSUSE, give them Live & Installable ISOs, give them VM images. Give them the tools needed to get the job done!

We could always pimp these developer kits at the specific language conferences like PyCon, RailsConf etc.

We have many programming experts within the community, so why don‚Äôt we pull from that expertise?¬† Let‚Äôs get openSUSE Developer kits for Java, Python, Qt, Python, Ruby, PHP, and any other language you think is beneficial.¬† This isn‚Äôt about what language is better than the next, it is about getting the message out and showing everyone that it really isnt hard to use openSUSE as your preferred platform.

So now that I‚Äôve said my piece, what tools do people think we are missing?¬† Also what issues do people have with our current tool set?¬† For goodness sake don‚Äôt just grumble about things let‚Äôs discuss constructively so we can fix things!

A bad workman always blames his tools, a good workman utilises his tools to their full extent.;T;

    <p>Yes I‚Äôm still at it, trying to get <span class="caps">YOU</span> the open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> community talking about what is important to you.¬† This time round I‚Äôd like to hear your opinions and thoughts about something.¬† I‚Äôm going to keep my views on the matter quiet until we get some dialogue going, so if you want to hear my thoughts (and let‚Äôs face it who doesn‚Äôt? ;-) ) best you start airing your&nbsp;opinions.</p>

<p>So what is the topic? That of Community Manager.¬† As many are aware, Novell have started interviewing for a replacement.¬† Some were not happy with how the role was done in the past and some and some were, but the key part of that statement is <span class="caps">PAST</span>!¬† Let‚Äôs move on and look to the future, and as part of that looking forward to the future I would like to hear what <span class="caps">YOU</span> would like from the new Community&nbsp;Manager?</p>

<p>So what is the topic? That of Community Manager.¬† As many are aware, Novell have started interviewing for a replacement.¬† Some were not happy with how the role was done in the past and some and some were, but the key part of that statement is PAST!¬† Let‚Äôs move on and look to the future, and as part of that looking forward to the future I would like to hear what YOU would like from the new Community Manager?</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a moment to see what the official blurb for the¬†<a href="http://careers.novell.com/psp/css89prd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM.HRS_CE.GBL" title="Official openSUSE Community Manager Vacancy at Novell">job vacancy</a>¬†said:</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>As openSUSE Community Manager, you will work to promote the openSUSE Project, openSUSE Build Service, and sub-projects such as the education project. Your key objectives will be to grow the number of openSUSE users and contributors, and further enhance Novell‚Äôs relationship with the openSUSE community and larger community of open source influencers and project maintainers. You will work closely with the openSUSE community, Novell leadership, and broader open source community. This is a unique opportunity to take a high-profile role in the open source world and make a truly global impact.</em>‚Äù</p>

<p>The listed key responsibilities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <em>Develop and execute a marketing plan to promote and evangelize openSUSE, in order to achieve the key objectives above.</em></li>
<li>  <em>Plan and execute launch plans for openSUSE product releases.</em></li>
<li>  <em>Serve as a frequent public face of the openSUSE Project to the community by blogging; seeking and providing press interviews; speaking at conferences and other events; and actively participating in social media. You will deliver fresh perspectives and thought leadership in these activities.</em></li>
<li>  <em>Work directly with &amp; facilitate activities for the openSUSE Ambassadors &amp; Marketing Team.</em></li>
<li>  <em>Engage with, support and encourage openSUSE community members via online venues such as IRC, forums, mailing lists and others.</em></li>
<li>  <em>Help to organize major events, including the openSUSE Conference.</em></li>
<li>  <em>Work closely with key stakeholders from openSUSE and Novell.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>So do you (dis)agree with what‚Äôs there?¬† What else would you add?¬† Also if you feel there is a particular issue that the new Community manager needs to address what is that issue, why should they be involved and how do you think they could resolve it?¬† How would you advertise the position?</p>

<p>People are bound to have opposing issue on items, and that is fine ‚Äì if anything it is healthy and should be promoted.¬† As always this is about having a discussion, not a flame war.¬† Please try and be curteous to your fellow community members and if you can‚Äôt say anything constructive ‚Äì don‚Äôt say anthing at all :-)</p>

<p>So people, let‚Äôs have your valuable opinions and thoughts on the matter.</p>

      <p>On The Road To Getting Focus&nbsp;Back</p>
    </div>

    <p>Some people may have noticed that I‚Äôve been fairly quiet on the Geeko front, this has been mainly down to an insane amount of work but also some other bits and&nbsp;bobs.</p>

<p>Some of those bits and bobs are a result of my mind running away with me, I like to believe that I‚Äôm a good thinker, some people say I‚Äôm a daydreamer, others say I have an over active imagination. Personally I reckon they‚Äôre all correct&nbsp;:-D</p>

<p>This has a downside though of loosing focus. ¬†If I was a business I would be bust or very close to going bust, as I no longer have sight of my core product and am trying to enter new markets with half hearted products that aren‚Äôt of any use to anybody. So something has to change, and as such I‚Äôm looking at trying to calm down and regain&nbsp;focus.</p>

<p>Previously focus wasn‚Äôt that difficult ‚Äì after all I was charging around getting dear old Smeegol out. That was no simple task and was hugely enjoyable even though many things would really tick me off. ¬†My pet project that I intended on doing was that little bit too crazy even for me, mainly because my C and Android knowledge isn‚Äôt up to the task, no development experience of LibreOffice and not a huge amount f spare time. ¬†As such I‚Äôm not going to be going forward with this. ¬†Luckily thanks to those kind folk at Google, LibreOffice has been accepted into <span class="caps">GSOC</span> and I believe this is one of the projects that will be&nbsp;mentored.</p>

<p>I was also looking at getting MeeGo‚Äôs new Tablet <span class="caps">UI</span> built on open<span class="caps">SUSE</span>, unfortunately I don‚Äôt really have the heart at the moment for this for some reason, and I‚Äôm not entirely sure I‚Äôm prepared for the massive amounts of pain involved. ¬†Oh, and as a minor item I don‚Äôt have any hardware to dogfood with. So I‚Äôm shelving this idea&nbsp;too.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to try and go back to roots, which means chipping in and helping out with the <span class="caps">GNOME</span> team, after all we can‚Äôt have it dominated by the French and Swiss now can we? ¬†I am also lucky enough to be a co-mentor for <span class="caps">GSOC</span> in getting Entomologist better. ¬†So this is something that I‚Äôm looking forward to ‚Äì hopefully I get to slowly and comfortably get better with Android and C ;-) ¬†I also want to try and blog a bit more.¬†I was hoping to be able to do some items as part of my job around Spacewalk and other bits, but unfortunately this hasn‚Äôt materialised&nbsp;:-(</p>

<p>So I‚Äôm going to try and focus any spare time on these two items, if anyone sees me do otherwise please slap me and remind me what it is I‚Äôm supposed to be&nbsp;doing.</p>

<p>Yay open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> is having a shindig in September, yes it‚Äôs the <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org" title="oSC11 homepage">open<span class="caps">SUSE</span> Conference 2011 (aka o<span class="caps">SC11</span>)</a>. And seeing as the theme is rwx¬≥ I‚Äôve submitted a couple of BoF propossals. ¬†Now they haven‚Äôt been approved yet, so I‚Äôm not 100% sure they‚Äôll happen but either way I‚Äôll be there and will be keen to talk to anyone that is&nbsp;interested.</p>

<p>The first topic I‚Äôd like to talk about is as the post‚Äôs subject says ‚ÄúDesigning the missing Web <span class="caps">UI</span> for&nbsp;Bongo‚Äù.</p>

<p>For un-aware the <a href="http://bongo-project.org" title="Bongo project homepage">Bongo</a> is an e-mail &amp; calendaring solution that can trace its roots back to Netmail. It is directly descended from Hula, which was a proof of concept email <span class="amp">&amp;</span> calendaring solution which had such luminary hackers such as Dave Camp, Peter Teichman, Nat Friedman, Garrett Le Sage and many others. ¬†Unfortunately due to commercial and other management decisions Hula was terminated. Yes it was honestly cool, and as a PoC it actually worked. Thankfully it was an open source project and was forked just before the door was closed, into the Bongo project. As part of the code clean up and ongoing development the existing <span class="caps">UI</span> had to be dropped due to code complexity, size and lack of resources for maintaining it. Which leads us to where we are&nbsp;now.</p>

<p>What we have now is a <span class="caps">MTA</span> backend that can be distributed over multiple servers or combined on a single machine. It‚Äôs pretty light weight and works. We support the usual protocols, so <span class="caps">IMAP</span> (with or without <span class="caps">TLS</span>/<span class="caps">SSL</span>), <span class="caps">POP3</span>, <span class="caps">SMTP</span> (currently we‚Äôve had to disable outgoing <span class="caps">TLS</span>/<span class="caps">SSL</span> due to a bug), Cal<span class="caps">DAV</span> (albeit in a simple form), anti-virus support for clamav, and anti-spam support with spamassassin. So the foundation blocks are there in place, all we‚Äôre missing is the shiny frontend&nbsp;beauty.</p>

<p>Just to be clear Bongo is not aimed at the ‚ÄúGroupware‚Äù market, so it isn‚Äôt aiming to compete with the likes of Zimbra, Exchange, Domino, GroupWise, OpenXchange etc. It is aimed at those that don‚Äôt require the bloat that comes with those big products, those that want a simple clean way to deal with e-mail and calendaring. A competitor could be viewed as Gmail Google Calendar, but self hosted at home/office or hosted as a service. Target audience I suppose could be viewed as individuals/families; <span class="caps">SOHO</span> that don‚Äôt need the bloat or intricate understanding of servers like postfix or sendmail with dovecot or similar; educational facilities ‚Äì you get the&nbsp;picture.</p>

<p>As I mentioned we have a fairly stable backend that provides email and calendaring, but the only way of interfacing with it is via a fat client (evolution, thunderbird, kmail, etc) ‚Äì I use it at home. What we need is a way of getting to it via a browser. The aim of my BoF proposal is to discuss ways of meeting that requirement, what technologies could and maybe should be used, going through pros <span class="amp">&amp;</span> cons and getting people interested in e-mail <span class="amp">&amp;</span> calendaring and web design&nbsp;involved.</p>

<p>As a project we have some ideas on technologies used, but at the end of the day this whole web joojoo is kind of out of developer‚Äôs field, so if one of you hipster hackers has a better idea and implements it then who are we to argue ;-) As an example we kind of like the idea of <span class="caps">HTML5</span> but we don‚Äôt have to be limited to that, at the end of the day we want a clean simple and functional <span class="caps">UI</span> ‚Äì both user and admin. We have a blank canvas so anything&nbsp;goes.</p>

<p>As Bongo can be a distributed solution it would also be great if the Web <span class="caps">UI</span> could be re-used in a way similar to Roundcube or Squirrelmail, Meaning you could use it as a generic web based <span class="caps">MUA</span> hooking into almost any mail server. This isn‚Äôt mandatory but a ‚Äúwould be nice to have‚Äù type feature. Initially we would be looking at something that provides core functionality ‚Äì email, calendaring <span class="amp">&amp;</span> contacts ‚Äì but can be extended via a plugin system maybe. Again that‚Äôs just a&nbsp;thought.</p>

<p>Hopefully we can get some real traction going and maybe after the BoF we can start to do some hacking on it :-) It would be absolutely awesome if by the end of the conference we had the beginings of a beautiful&nbsp;product.</p>

Yay openSUSE is having a shindig in September, yes it‚Äôs the [openSUSE Conference 2011 (aka oSC11)][2]. And seeing as the theme is rwx¬≥ I‚Äôve submitted a couple of BoF propossals. ¬†Now they haven‚Äôt been approved yet, so I‚Äôm not 100% sure they‚Äôll happen but either way I‚Äôll be there and will be keen to talk to anyone that is interested.

 [2]: http://conference.opensuse.org "oSC11 homepage"

The first topic I‚Äôd like to talk about is as the post‚Äôs subject says ‚ÄúDesigning the missing Web UI for Bongo‚Äù.

For un-aware the [Bongo][3] is an e-mail & calendaring solution that can trace its roots back to Netmail. It is directly descended from Hula, which was a proof of concept email & calendaring solution which had such luminary hackers such as Dave Camp, Peter Teichman, Nat Friedman, Garrett Le Sage and many others. ¬†Unfortunately due to commercial and other management decisions Hula was terminated. Yes it was honestly cool, and as a PoC it actually worked. Thankfully it was an open source project and was forked just before the door was closed, into the Bongo project. As part of the code clean up and ongoing development the existing UI had to be dropped due to code complexity, size and lack of resources for maintaining it. Which leads us to where we are now.

 [3]: http://bongo-project.org "Bongo project homepage"

What we have now is a MTA backend that can be distributed over multiple servers or combined on a single machine. It‚Äôs pretty light weight and works. We support the usual protocols, so IMAP (with or without TLS/SSL), POP3, SMTP (currently we‚Äôve had to disable outgoing TLS/SSL due to a bug), CalDAV (albeit in a simple form), anti-virus support for clamav, and anti-spam support with spamassassin. So the foundation blocks are there in place, all we‚Äôre missing is the shiny frontend beauty.

Just to be clear Bongo is not aimed at the ‚ÄúGroupware‚Äù market, so it isn‚Äôt aiming to compete with the likes of Zimbra, Exchange, Domino, GroupWise, OpenXchange etc. It is aimed at those that don‚Äôt require the bloat that comes with those big products, those that want a simple clean way to deal with e-mail and calendaring. A competitor could be viewed as Gmail Google Calendar, but self hosted at home/office or hosted as a service. Target audience I suppose could be viewed as individuals/families; SOHO that don‚Äôt need the bloat or intricate understanding of servers like postfix or sendmail with dovecot or similar; educational facilities ‚Äì you get the picture.

As I mentioned we have a fairly stable backend that provides email and calendaring, but the only way of interfacing with it is via a fat client (evolution, thunderbird, kmail, etc) ‚Äì I use it at home. What we need is a way of getting to it via a browser. The aim of my BoF proposal is to discuss ways of meeting that requirement, what technologies could and maybe should be used, going through pros & cons and getting people interested in e-mail & calendaring and web design involved.

As a project we have some ideas on technologies used, but at the end of the day this whole web joojoo is kind of out of developer‚Äôs field, so if one of you hipster hackers has a better idea and implements it then who are we to argue ;-) As an example we kind of like the idea of HTML5 but we don‚Äôt have to be limited to that, at the end of the day we want a clean simple and functional UI ‚Äì both user and admin. We have a blank canvas so anything goes.

As Bongo can be a distributed solution it would also be great if the Web UI could be re-used in a way similar to Roundcube or Squirrelmail, Meaning you could use it as a generic web based MUA hooking into almost any mail server. This isn‚Äôt mandatory but a ‚Äúwould be nice to have‚Äù type feature. Initially we would be looking at something that provides core functionality ‚Äì email, calendaring & contacts ‚Äì but can be extended via a plugin system maybe. Again that‚Äôs just a thought.

Hopefully we can get some real traction going and maybe after the BoF we can start to do some hacking on it :-) It would be absolutely awesome if by the end of the conference we had the beginings of a beautiful product.

So please [register][6] for the conference and join in the fun.

Yes it was honestly cool, and as a PoC it actually worked. Thankfully it was an open source project and was forked just before the door was closed, into the Bongo project. As part of the code clean up and ongoing development the existing UI had to be dropped due to code complexity, size and lack of resources for maintaining it. Which leads us to where we are now.</p>

<p>What we have now is a MTA backend that can be distributed over multiple servers or combined on a single machine. It‚Äôs pretty light weight and works. We support the usual protocols, so IMAP (with or without TLS/SSL), POP3, SMTP (currently we‚Äôve had to disable outgoing TLS/SSL due to a bug), CalDAV (albeit in a simple form), anti-virus support for clamav, and anti-spam support with spamassassin. So the foundation blocks are there in place, all we‚Äôre missing is the shiny frontend beauty.</p>

<p>Just to be clear Bongo is not aimed at the ‚ÄúGroupware‚Äù market, so it isn‚Äôt aiming to compete with the likes of Zimbra, Exchange, Domino, GroupWise, OpenXchange etc. It is aimed at those that don‚Äôt require the bloat that comes with those big products, those that want a simple clean way to deal with e-mail and calendaring. A competitor could be viewed as Gmail Google Calendar, but self hosted at home/office or hosted as a service. Target audience I suppose could be viewed as individuals/families; SOHO that don‚Äôt need the bloat or intricate understanding of servers like postfix or sendmail with dovecot or similar; educational facilities ‚Äì you get the picture.</p>

<p>As I mentioned we have a fairly stable backend that provides email and calendaring, but the only way of interfacing with it is via a fat client (evolution, thunderbird, kmail, etc) ‚Äì I use it at home. What we need is a way of getting to it via a browser. The aim of my BoF proposal is to discuss ways of meeting that requirement, what technologies could and maybe should be used, going through pros &amp; cons and getting people interested in e-mail &amp; calendaring and web design involved.</p>

<p>As a project we have some ideas on technologies used, but at the end of the day this whole web joojoo is kind of out of developer‚Äôs field, so if one of you hipster hackers has a better idea and implements it then who are we to argue ;-) As an example we kind of like the idea of HTML5 but we don‚Äôt have to be limited to that, at the end of the day we want a clean simple and functional UI ‚Äì both user and admin. We have a blank canvas so anything goes.</p>

<p>As Bongo can be a distributed solution it would also be great if the Web UI could be re-used in a way similar to Roundcube or Squirrelmail, Meaning you could use it as a generic web based MUA hooking into almost any mail server. This isn‚Äôt mandatory but a ‚Äúwould be nice to have‚Äù type feature. Initially we would be looking at something that provides core functionality ‚Äì email, calendaring &amp; contacts ‚Äì but can be extended via a plugin system maybe. Again that‚Äôs just a thought.</p>

<p>Hopefully we can get some real traction going and maybe after the BoF we can start to do some hacking on it :-) It would be absolutely awesome if by the end of the conference we had the beginings of a beautiful product.</p>

<p>So please <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/confRegistrationFormDisplay.py?confId=2" title="oSC11 registration page">register</a> for the conference and join in the fun.</p>

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2013/09/28/eurobsdcon-devsummit-day-2.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://2013.eurobsdcon.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/EuroBSDcon-2013-Daemon-small.png" alt="EuroBSDCon 2013 Malta"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of EuroBSDCon (overview of &lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2013/09/27/eurobsdcon-devsummit-day-1.html" title="Overview of Day 1 of EuroBSDCon DevSummit"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;)kicked off for me with the morning being dedicated to virtualization. In Linux we're all used to the usual suspects - KVM/Xen/LXC/VMWare, so I was interested to hear what's available on FreeBSD especially &lt;a href="http://blogs.arm.com/software-enablement/1079-transparent-superpages-for-freebsd-on-arm/" title="SuperPage support on FreeBSD by SemiHalf"&gt;bhyve&lt;/a&gt; which is probably as close to KVM as one will get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Xen support is available in FreeBSD, but only as DomU (guest VM). Dom0 (host server) support is actively being worked on though to rectify this shortfall (this does not apply to NetBSD). Xen PVHVM support is included in FreeBSD 10. 
*VMWare support is available for FreeBSD guests. 
*Not overly surprising LXC is not supported but FreeBSD does have Jails. 
*HyperV support is also included to run FreeBSD as a guest on Microsoft's virtualization platform.
*An overview of bhyve's status was then given, including a demo of a FreeBSD host running a CentOS guest and an Ubuntu guest. The CentOS VM was a pre-installed image and the Ubuntu VM was a new install. This showed that bhyve can support installation of VMs via ISO images thanks to the newly commit AHCI support. Currently bhyve only supports x86 as an architecture, but there are plans to support ARM; this is mainly due to resources avilable etc. bhyve shows a lot of promise and it will be great to see competition in the virtualization space on FreeBSD, just like there is on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon was taken up by the Vendor session, where companies that support and use FreeBSD gave presentations and discussed what was needed/wanted/missing/broken. The session was kicked of by the FreeBSD Foundation. It's always encouraging to see a Foundation show how well they are growing, and how they have helped the project. As an example, the FreeBSD Foundation funded &lt;a href="http://blogs.arm.com/software-enablement/1079-transparent-superpages-for-freebsd-on-arm/" title="SuperPage support on FreeBSD by SemiHalf"&gt;SuperPage support&lt;/a&gt; on ARM. This was followed by an overview of a startup in Japan that focuses on FreeBSD consultancy services, many major Japanese companies are FreeBSD users including Sony (PS4) and Panasonic (I forget the products they ship with FreeBSD). After that there was the discussion session which started off with a brief overview of the upcoming version of FreeBSD - 10.0. FreeBSD 10 has switched to LLVM as the default backend compiler, using clang for both x86 and ARM. There will be GCC support but it will not be used by default, the target is GCC 4.9. A good overview of new features comming up in the soon to be released FreeBSD 10 can be found &lt;a href="http://www.freebsdnews.net/2013/09/20/freebsd-10s-new-technologies-and-features/" title="New features in FreeBSD 10"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://2013.eurobsdcon.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/EuroBSDcon-2013-Daemon-small.png" alt="EuroBSDCon 2013 Malta"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my role at work I get to interact with various Open Source projects, and not all of them are Linux related. This week I'm on the beautiful, historic, sunny and warm island of Malta attending &lt;a href="http://2013.eurobsdcon.org" title="2013 European *BSD Conference"&gt;EuroBSDCon&lt;/a&gt;. As you can work out from the name, it is the European gathering of BSD developers and users covering all the BSD variants like &lt;a href="http://www.freebsd.org/" title="FreeBSD"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.netbsd.org/" title="NetBSD"&gt;NetBSD&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/" title="OpenBSD"&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.pcbsd.org/" title="PC-BSD"&gt;PCBSD&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org/" title="Dragonfly BSD"&gt;Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt;. I'm giving a talk on ARMv8 and AArch64 on Sunday, so hopefully that will go well, I'm somewhat nervous as I finished my slides before I left which is somewhat unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4 day event is split in two, with the first couple of days being dedicated to BSD developers; all of day 1 and day 2 is dedicated to FreeBSD, and half of day 2 is dedicated to NetBSD. These developer sessions are targetted at the core developers, the guys and girls that commit code into the BSD repositories, are part of the core teams like security/maintanence/etc., and is a great insight into the workings and planning of their distributions. It's somewhat encouraging to see the BSD communities suffer from some of the same issues that afflict Linux, package name differences between distros being one. Having attended numerous distro related conferences (FUDCon/UDS/oSC), it was interesting to see how the FreeBSD camp do things - maybe useful to do something similar with oSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most conferences, the hall way track is priceless. I managed to catch up with a couple of the FreeBSD ARM developers and was enlightened to some interesting issues that they're experienceing, and got a good first hand account on the status of the port. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about 150 attendees at the DevSummit, and it seems that the Dutch and Poles have invaded with a smattering of French (either they out number people or they're just noisey buggers :-) ). Unfortunately the M/F ratio is pretty poor, with only 2% women. Regardless the BSD crowd are a fun and interesting bunch, and I'm looking forward to working with the BSD community more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, &lt;a href="http://www.arm.com/" title="The Architecture for the Digital World"&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="http://www.arm.com/about/careers/index.php" title="Job vacancies at ARM"&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;! If your on the market for a job, have a look and if you apply just say I sent you ;-) &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to get a present for surviving another year of life, a shiny new &lt;a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/" title="Consumer Quadricopter"&gt;AR.Drone2.0&lt;/a&gt;. This was something that I had desired sometime ago but then dismissed as an expensive toy with little expansion. That desire returned recently after being enlightened to the hacking opportunities, not just hacking the device directly but more around the hacking of applications to use with it. Yet again it was &lt;a href="http://www.eschnou.com/" title="Eschnou's spot on the web"&gt;Laurent Eschenauer&lt;/a&gt; to blame with his excellent &lt;a href="http://eschnou.github.io/ardrone-webflight/" title="ardrone-webflight homepage"&gt;ardrone-webflight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nodecopter.com/" title="NodeCopter"&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/nodecopter-logo.png" alt="NodeCopter"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I've really looked at &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/" title="Server based JavaScript"&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;, and it is actually a pretty powerful framework. Laurent and co have done a fabulous job at hooking into the APIs that are exposed by the AR.Drone2.0. &lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2013/06/14/changed-blogging-system-again.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been almost 18 months since I last made any &lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2012/02/17/update-to-europeanwafaa.html" title="European Wafaa moves to Wordpress"&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; to this site, and I've been meaning to do it for a while. In all honesty, it's been a while since I last blogged so I thought it was as good a time as any. Thanks to the likes of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/awafaa" title="Me on Twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/103092666279088875227" title="Me on Google+"&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt;, and my &lt;a href="http://forums.arm.com/index.php?app=core&amp;amp;module=search&amp;amp;do=user_activity&amp;amp;search_app=blog&amp;amp;mid=123654&amp;amp;userMode=&amp;amp;sid=104957ef65b11d07747c3f0a9b12527d" title="My corporate blog posts"&gt;corporate&lt;/a&gt; blog I'm finding myself blogging less an less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my blog is getting less content, is it really worth running an sql server etc? I don't think it is. There's the system overhead (I'll explain why I'm thinking about system overhead in another post), the maintanence of a critical component, the backups etc. &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress blogging tool"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is OK, but it really is overkill for simple blogging. After seeing peers, friends, and general interweb related buzz, I finally decided to move and use a static site generator. Problem is which one - there are loads?! I read and an LWN &lt;a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/541299/" title="LWN article on static site generators"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; which somewhat helped, so now I needed to choose. I finally bit the bullet and went for &lt;a href="http://nanoc.ws" title="Nanoc, a Ruby based static site generator"&gt;Nanoc&lt;/a&gt; after recommendations from trusted people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I'm loving it. I had already started to get into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" title="Wikipedia's entry on Markdown"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, so creating content using the language was easy enough (I'm by no means an expert though). I get most of the functions that I want straight out of the box, it renders perfectly regardless of browser - desktop or mobile, it is immensly portable, backups are a breeze, and overall maintanence is simple. I regularily ask myself why I took so long to make the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the move I've also rejigged URLs etc, so if you crazily had my blog bookmarked for whatever reason you will need to update. I've not quite finished fiddling yet, I've not implemented comments yet, but you could always use G+ or whatever in the meantime. I also want to tweak the theme and some other bits. I'd like to thank &lt;a href="http://nordisch.org/" title="darix's blog"&gt;Marcus Ruckert&lt;/a&gt; for helping me with some of the code tweaks, &lt;a href="http://ithaca.arpinum.org/" title="Ithaca's blog"&gt;Peter Aronoff&lt;/a&gt; for the current theme and some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://conference.opensuse.org" title="openSUSE Conference 2013, 18-22 July, Thessaloniki, Greece"&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/osc13logo400x283.png" alt="openSUSE Conference 2013"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://conference.opensuse.org" title="openSUSE Conference 2013, 18-22 July, Thessaloniki, Greece"&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/go-osc13_200x200.png" alt="I'm Going to oSC13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just published a &lt;a href="http://blogs.arm.com/software-enablement/935-spotlight-on-the-linux-software-ecosystem-opensuse/" title="ARM Spotlight on openSUSE"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on ARM's corporate blog with an overview of the recent &lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2013/03/14/geeko-pumping-iron-session-opensuse-arm-hackathon-08-12apr.html" title="Geeko Pumping Iron Session"&gt;openSUSE ARM Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;. We didn't quite manage all the tasks that we had hoped for, but we did get the big ones done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me it was great to meet so many old friends, and some new ones. I'd like to say a few thanks to some of the people involved, they all did so much and this is just some of the things that they did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2013/03/14/geeko-pumping-iron-session-opensuse-arm-hackathon-08-12apr.html" title="Geeko Pumping Iron Session"&gt;openSUSE TSP&lt;/a&gt; for helping Guillaume Gardet attend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guillaume, for his hardware doctor skills which were more than valuable and his dogged determination is a shining example. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bernhard Wiedemann, for getting OpenStack working properly &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert Schweikert, for getting down and dirty with the Chromebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dirk M√ºller for integration of the new hardware into OBS and Cubiboard bring up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinhard Max for deploying the new hardware in the data centre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lars Vogdt and team for maintanence &amp;amp; support of the hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luc Verhagen for being a bad influence and trying to get us all to party &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Egbert Eich for looking at the scary situation of ARM related Xorg stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marcus Sch√§fer for al the kiwi and Origen work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex Graf for so much low level grunt work that without whom we wouldn't be in the current state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SUSE for sponsoring both the location &amp;amp; accomodation and also for the occaisional breakfast and lunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_Ream" title="D:Ream, the group"&gt;D:Ream&lt;/a&gt;, things can only get better :-) Feel free to &lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM" title="openSUSE on ARM Portal"&gt;join in&lt;/a&gt;, and have some fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get openSUSE 12.3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that openSUSE 12.3 is out, the &lt;a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM" title="openSUSE on ARM"&gt;openSUSE ARM Team&lt;/a&gt; want to step up a gear. As the cycle was shorter than normal, there are a few wrinkles that need to be ironed out and also a whole heap of new things that can be added. After some discussion at FOSDEM, it was decided to hold a Hackathon to address these items. The Hackathon will take place on 08 to 12 April, both at the SUSE offices in Nuremberg as well as online for those that can‚Äôt attend in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a TODO list which comprises the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  ¬†AArch64 fixes for 12.3 &amp;amp; Factory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  ¬†Resolve outstanding 12.3 package issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  ¬†Test and release 12.3 images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  ¬†Create OpenStack images for¬†ARM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  ¬†Get KVM and Xen on Chromebook &amp;amp; Arndale running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  ¬†OBS improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be the opportunity for new device bring up for those that want to, but our intention is to work through and complete as much of the above TODO list as possible first. For those interested in joining in the fun, please either join us in Nuremberg and/or join the &lt;a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm/" title="openSUSE on ARM mailing list archive"&gt;opensuse-arm mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="irc://freenode.net/#opensuse-arm" title="openSUSE on ARM IRC"&gt;#opensuse-arm&lt;/a&gt; IRC channel on Freenode and also keep an eye on the &lt;a href="https://trello.com/board/opensuse-on-arm/5007cfc12cf0ae352e21d8dc" title="openSUSE on ARM Trello board"&gt;openSUSE on ARM Trello board&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any questions please let us know on the mailing list or on IRC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have blogged about how to get &lt;a href="http://blogs.arm.com/software-enablement/848-running-linux-on-the-series-3-chromebook/" title="Manual process to get Linux on the Chromebook"&gt;Linux on the Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; in the past; and whilst the process works, it isn‚Äôt the easiest or most friendly way. Thanks to the tireless work of the openSUSE ARM Team (especially Alex Graf and¬†Marcus Sch√§fer) we now have a simpler way to get openSUSE on the Chromebook. ¬†We now have an installable image that can be dd‚Äôed directly to either an SD card or USB drive (I‚Äôve not tried the internal eMMC) just like any other ARM device. To get the goodies check out the &lt;a href="https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:ARMChromebook" title="Series 3 Chromebook on openSUSE's Wiki"&gt;Chromebook wiki page&lt;/a&gt;. This process has numerous advantages to the manual process, chief amongst them is easy updating of the Kernel and painless deployment of the image. There are various things that need fixing still, but they are being worked on and will happen soon(ish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a Chromebook, please try it out and let us know how things work or don‚Äôt for you on IRC #opensuse-arm on Freenode and/or the &lt;a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/" title="openSUSE Mailing List Archive"&gt;opensuse-arm&lt;/a&gt; mailing list . Please take note of the known issues on the wiki page before shouting ;-) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;
Some people asked about card/stick size to use. If you want to just use the JeOS image which is command line only, then the minimum size is 1GB, if however you wish to use the XFCE image or use JeOS and then install a DE on top then the real minimum would be 4GB. Thanks to Kiwi, the images are self extracting. This means that when you complete the first boot process it will use up all the space on your target media, so 4/8/16/32/64/128GB depending on what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is now &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; hardware from ARM‚Äôs partners that offers the ability to leverage hardware virtualisation, in a similar fashion to Intel and AMD. So far three devices are shipping to the general public ‚Äì the new &lt;a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/pc-peripherals/chrome-devices/chrome-devices/XE303C12-A01UK" title="ARM powered Chromebook"&gt;Series 3 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_10_16gb&amp;amp;feature=nexus10_campaign" title="Google Nexus 10"&gt;Nexus 10&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.arndaleboard.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" title="Exynos 5 development board"&gt;Arndale board&lt;/a&gt;. They all have one key factor in common, the &lt;a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/product/application/detail?productId=7668" title="Samsung's first Cortex-A15"&gt;Samsung Exynos5&lt;/a&gt; SoC. This fine piece of silicon is a member of the Cortex-A15 family which introduces the required virtualisation extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily openSUSE managed to get hold of an Arndale board last month, and Alex Graf, Marcus Sch√§fer and others have been hard at work getting the Geeko working on the device. I‚Äôm pleased to say that their hard work has paid off, you can now run &lt;a href="https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Arndale" title="Arndale &amp;amp; openSUSE"&gt;openSUSE on the Arndale&lt;/a&gt; with some caveats ‚Äì no graphics/display atm, so serial or SSH access only for now. One of the drivers to getting the Arndale up and running was to test out Virtualisation. Below you can see a quick and dirty display of me using KVM and running three (3) VMs on the board ‚Äì openSUSE, Fedora, Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/SL313KEYQCc" title="Screencast of KVM running on an Arndale"&gt;Direct YouTube Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn‚Äôt perfect as the guest kernel is missing DEVTMPFS support, and some of the KVM tools are missing; these are being worked on so the future will be bright ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After my &lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2012/10/25/geeko-goes-chrome.html" title="Geeko goes Chrome"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday on getting openSUSE on the new ARM Chromebook, a lot of interest was generated with discussions on various forms of media ‚Äì heck I even got Slashdotted (thanks :-) ). I read some but not all of them and even the comments. One thing popped out to me, and I feel I need to clarify some things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Whilst I do indeed work for ARM, my device was a private purchase and not provided to me by my employer. Luckily as part of my role I am able to spend time doing fun things like getting openSUSE on the Chromebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I have never taken credit for doing all the hard work of working out what needed to be done to get openSUSE on the Chromebook, the hard work was done by Olof Johanssen as I mentioned. He wrote up some excellent steps that were very easy to follow. I and all other people interested in getting Linux on the Chromebook regardless of distro are¬†indebted to Olof for his work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I am not responsible or incharge of getting openSUSE on ARM. It is a collaborative effort by the community, and there are many others that have put in a whole heap of hard work doing things that I can only aspire to do. To name a few of the fine people in our community that have put in the time and effort would be a mistake as I will undoubtedly miss some people off the list, but it is ¬†a mistake I‚Äôm willing to accept so here goes -¬†Adrian Schr√∂ter, Alex Graf,¬†Joop Boonen,¬†Guillaume Gardet,¬†Marcus Sch√§fer,¬†Dirk M√ºller,¬†Andreas F√§rber,¬†Bernhard Wiedemann,¬†Bamvor Jian Zhang,¬†Peter Czanik,¬†Michal Vyskocil, and many more. Without the blood, sweat and tears that these fine folk have shed we would not be in the position we are now; so thank you all for your hard work and long may it continue :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that will clarify any confusion that some people may have had, and sorry to those that I missed off the list ‚Äì if you feel hard done by me omitting your name off this list please let me know and I will make sure you get the credit you deserve!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to get into work today to have a lovely package waiting for me, a shiny new ARM powered &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/chrome/devices/" title="Chromebook from Google"&gt;Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;! o/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DU2h_NAGb0s/UIjtNzL9o1I/AAAAAAAAAj0/KUT53k2QoT0/s1068/2012+-+1" alt="New ARM powered Chromebook" title="New ARM powered Chromebook"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered it specifically to have a good mobile ARM development platform. So after having used the bundled ChromeOS for the first half of the day I decided it was time to get this machine‚Äôs Geeko on. Thankfully one of the Google employed developers , Olof Johansson, was kind enough to post his &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/109993695638569781190/posts/b2fazijJppZ" title="Steps to get Linux on the Chromebook"&gt;steps&lt;/a&gt; to get Linux on the machine. So after my meetings were done, I &lt;a href="http://download.opensuse.org/ports/armv7hl/distribution/12.2-RC1/images/" title="openSUSE ARM Images"&gt;downloaded&lt;/a&gt; the openSUSE 12.2 RC1 JeOS image and followed Olof‚Äôs steps. Everything worked a treat and it was an exceptionally painless process, and proof is in the blurry cam :-) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fPsB-WRyE0A/UIlcOPHzALI/AAAAAAAAAlA/JQFSh0fc6oQ/s1068/2012+-+1" alt="openSUSE running on the Chromebook" title="openSUSE running on the Chromebook"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now need to connect to a suitable network so that I can try out some of the desktop environments, and see how well things work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://solid-run.com/images/CuBox/cubox-scaled.jpg" alt="Cubox next to a coin" title="CuBox"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, some of the fine chaps over at Geeko Central managed to get the delightful little &lt;a href="http://solid-run.com/products/cubox" title="CuBox by SolidRun"&gt;CuBox&lt;/a&gt; working with openSUSE. This was helped by the fine folks at SolidRun sponsoring a couple of devices for the work, thanks SolidRun!¬† It isn‚Äôt 100% feature complete, but it is good enough for use as a server. The missing components are Audio and Video, so it is pretty much a headless style configuration at the moment like the Snowball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannes Reinecke who wrestled things into shape has submitted several patches back to SolidRun to help try and improve things, remember folks openSUSE is inclusive and we like to give back ;-) As for installing it on your own CuBox, at present there is no pre-built image, but that is coming ‚Äì honest. We just need to wait for the new kernel-cubox to filter through and then we can ask kiwi to do its magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This now means we have openSUSE running on a wide variety of ARMv7 powered devices ‚Äì Pandaboard family, Beagleboard family, Snowball, EfikaMX family &amp;amp; AC100. Next up is the Origen board hopefully ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After five years at &lt;a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/uk/" title="Fujitsu UK"&gt;Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt; it is time for me to move on. I‚Äôve had a blast, both good and bad, whilst there and was lucky enough to have experienced and hopefully learnt a lot. Whist there I‚Äôve worked in all sorts of verticals; including but not limited to Government, Financial, Education, Science and HPC. Although I was brought in to deal with Linux and Open Source it was never limited to that and was lucky enough to have been exposed to a multitude of technologies that I wouldn‚Äôt have known about had it not been due to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm no longer going to be based from home, but will be based out of the fine city of Cambridge working for &lt;a href="http://www.arm.com/" title="The architecture for the digital world"&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt;. As for what I‚Äôm going to do exactly, all I‚Äôll say is that it is going to be very much Open Source related (which makes me happier than a pig in poo!). I will be on leave until I start my new role, which is when I‚Äôll tell more. I am confident that I wont need to curtail my involvement with openSUSE, if anything I will have to start getting involved with many more projects. I‚Äôm really excited at the prospect of working with other distributions, the folks at Linaro, ARM‚Äôs partners, and the wider community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, have a lot of fun folks :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately one of the down sides to the 21st Century is that most people have either been directly affected by or know someone close that has been directly affected by cancer; this is a beast that takes many shapes and forms. The mortality rate for the disease is coming down slowly, but the fact is people still die from it. ¬†Unfortunately this is what happened to my mother-in-law last year :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane was a wonderful woman that was completely focused on family, she was a true matriarch. She was loved and adored not just by her immediate family but also by the large extended family, especially the children where she had an almost magical way. It was a great shock when she passed away, especially as she had fought off breast cancer in the winter of 2010 and had made a pretty god recovery even if she had to have a mastectomy. Unfortunately the cancer returned with a vengeance in the spring of 2011 and attacked her brain and her liver, the latter was especially bad. She lost her battle after after only a short few months and passed away in the summer of 2011 at the young age of 59. She left a husband, three children and seven grandchildren as well as being an aunt and surrogate grandparent to many many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her husband, Chris, was looking forward to celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary in October of 2011, but¬†unfortunately¬†this was not to be. As a result he has taken the decision to do something in her memory and try an raise funds and awareness for cancer research and cures for this horrible disease. He will be embarking on a 5day trek in Peru going up to Maccu Pichu and back down again, which is fine if you‚Äôre a spritely 20 or 30 something, but Chris is 65 so his body isn‚Äôt as forgiving. It is with this that I kindly ask for your help in getting him to his ambitious goal. I appreciate that there are many charities asking for your help, and many others requesting donations of one form or anther; but please help Chris reach his goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please donate whatever you can by heading over to his donations &lt;a href="http://www.justgiving.com/Chris-Morffew" title="Please donate to Chris' effort"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;. With your help maybe we can find a way of helping more family members survive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm somewhat surprised at how many people are getting upset about the &lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Low cost ARM based board"&gt;RaspberryPi&lt;/a&gt;. They are grumbling about how it is a weak, underpowered device with the only plus point being the exceptionally low price. ¬†People, this device was devised and built for a specific task ‚Äì getting children coding and learning about computers in general!! The price point is crucial, one could give it to a 4yr old (or 40yr old) and not worry too much if it¬†accidentally¬†gets juice poured on it or covered in chocolate spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure you can do the same sort of thing and then some more with a more powerful Pandaboard or any other ARMv7 powered device; but as a device to introduce little ones to the art of programming and all things computer related I think it is perfect. It is designed for the task of educating and as such doesn‚Äôt need or even want all the frills that a more powerful board can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything is about the highest specification. As long as there is enough oomph to get those inquisitive minds hacking, then there is no issue. Yes it would have been preferable if it was powered by an ARMv7, but the ARMv6 is more than capable for the task it is being used for. So what if one can‚Äôt run KDE4 or GNOME-shell? Those little fingers need to learn to use an editor for code, so a simple IDE or dare I say it ‚Äì VI or EMACS ‚Äì don‚Äôt need all the flashy whizz bang the big DEs provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would be even better is if we could get openSUSE on the darling little thing. The thing is we have placed our stake in the ground and are focusing on ARMv7. This does not mean we won‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to support ARMv6, we just need to focus otherwise we will never get anywhere. So if you would like to see a Raspberry flavoured Geeko then you are more than welcome to help out. The ARM team will help where we can and provide advice etc, but our time and effort is limited so don‚Äôt expect us to dive in and do the work for you ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2012/02/23/when-geekos-with-arms-get-together.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm here in the belly of the Geeko at SUSE‚Äôs offices in Nuremberg, due to the fact that the new openSUSE &lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Board" title="The openSUSE Board"&gt;Board&lt;/a&gt; had their Face to Face meeting yesterday (whole different topic needing its own post ;-) ). As I was coming here I thought it would be prudent to try and get the various people dealing with and interested in the ARM port around a table at some point to discus the status of things. Yes, I know there are several people missing from the discussion ‚Äì like those in the Prague office, and those not employed at SUSE ‚Äì but getting everyone together will have to wait until the openSUSE Conference later this year :-) . Thanks to Bernhard who cajoled folk, we just finished having a fairly productive meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intention of the meeting was to try and get some form of milestones agreed, and work out our next moves and find out what tasks etc need to be done. ¬†Several¬†decisions¬†were made:
1. ARMv7 is the focus. This isn‚Äôt necessarily news, but we just wanted to¬†reiterate the message. Also the ARMv5 builds are going to have their priorities in the OBS lowered to minimise the build power consumption. We‚Äôre not deleting them,¬†¬†just not focusing on them; if someone &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; wants v5 builds then best you roll your sleeves up and get stuck ¬†in, we will provide support, guidance and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are aiming for 12.2 to have full ARM support. So this means we need to freeze in time for 12.2 RC1, so we can not have any build failures. If there are we need to fix them, but some applications are known not to run on ARM, where these are identified we will just use &lt;code&gt;ExcludeArch: %arm&lt;/code&gt;. This needs to be done by 01June2012 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure we can make the deadline we need to make sure that all sources are submitted into Factory via the respective devel projects. This means that we have no source overlays in the openSUSE:Factory:ARM repo. Also that all hacks and ‚Äúfixes‚Äù are discussed with maintainers and either incorporated or better fixes are submitted. We will &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; have separate sources or patches for the ARM port, everything will have to be in Factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to have a reference platform that &lt;strong&gt;ALL¬†&lt;/strong&gt;developers can use to verify 12.2 will work, this will be the Pandaboard. This does not mean we will not be supporting other devices, like Snowball, Beagleboard or Origen; they will be available but they may not have gone through the same¬†rigorous¬†tests. We will also look at having XFCE as the reference platform Desktop Environment. Now before anyone starts calling for blood, there were some reasons for refernece platform decision:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  a.) There are sufficient numbers of Pandaboards for developers to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  b.) Pandaboard has the best upstream support out of all the devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  c.) We already have Kiwi based images for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  d.) XFCE is the only DE that builds almost completely and runs at the moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  e.) 2D graphics work out of the box on the Pandaboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;openSUSE‚Äôs ARM port has gone on a diet. The Geeko is now FATless, this means we no longer have a¬†separate¬†FAT partition for the boot file system. All partitions are now ext3 by default, BTRFS is supported but isn‚Äôt our default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kiwi generated images will use the OEM format rather than the Live Install format. Basically this means that a user will &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; the image to the target SD card and then the ‚Äúsecond boot‚Äù process will kick in when a user boots from the card so that they can configure passwords/network/etc and it will repartition to take up the whole of the card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernhard is going to look at integrating ARM support into &lt;a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/" title="Q&amp;amp;A in the open"&gt;OpenQA&lt;/a&gt;. This means we can get advance notice of breakages etc. prior to releasing images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be triggering a rebuild of the ARM repo to ensure that builds take into account some of the big changes that have happened in Factory (like the Xorg changes), and also to clean out any ‚Äúfixes‚Äù that were applied to the repo. This will most likely be initiated in batches rather than the complete repo, hopefully we can avoid the repo being out of¬†commission¬†for four weeks this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another outcome of the meeting was working out some tasks that needed to be completed. There aren‚Äôt that many tasks and they are open to &lt;strong&gt;EVERYONE&lt;/strong&gt; to help out with: 
* I.) We need to keep a closer eye on the package failures. Using Dirk‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://www.suse.de/%7Edmueller/arm-buildservice/" title="Compare Native/Qemu/IBS/OBS builds"&gt;Build Comparison page&lt;/a&gt; will help to isolate failures due to qemu. All qemu¬†bugs/issues need to be passed on to either Alexander Graf (agraf) or Andreas Farber (afarber) for fixing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;II.) We need to look at YaST‚Äôs second stage module and see if that will be of use to the ARM port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;III.) We really need to re-work the wiki for the ARM port. It needs to be much more detailed as it hasn‚Äôt been updated in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that gives us three months or 12 weeks to get our house in order. If you want to see openSUSE get a decent release on ARM, then join in and help out!! You don‚Äôt need to know packaging/architecture/code to help, jump on IRC (#opensuse-arm on Freenode) or send a mail to the mailing list (opensuse-arm make sure you subscribe first) and ask questions and get your hands dirty ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just on the off chance that anyone has tried to browse to my blog or any other part of my web presence on the wafaa.eu domain, you may have noticed that it was returning either with no content or pile of garbled mess. Well the reason is I decided to do a bit of a tidy up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve finally migrated completely to my Microserver, and have retired my old but trusty Compaq Evo. I have also re-organised subdomains etc, so if you for some reason bookmarked my site you will need to update your bookmarks with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog ‚Äì &lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/blog" title="New blog location for European Wafaa"&gt;http://andrew.wafaa.eu/blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to switch to &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org" title="One of the most widely used blogging tools"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; for the blogging side of things as it has more features and functionality than what Storytlr provides. Saying that though I‚Äôm sticking with &lt;a href="http://storytlr.org" title="A way of collating your interactions on the internet"&gt;Storytlr&lt;/a&gt; for pulling in the feeds from my random interactions on the interwebs, I still think it‚Äôs the best tool for that as the WordPress plugins that do a similar thing just don‚Äôt compare.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">openSUSE on ARM Update 310112</title>
    <published>2012-01-31T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2012-01-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2012/01/31/opensuse-on-arm-update-310112.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a little over a month since the last update and as always there has been progress :-) First let‚Äôs get some of the numbers out of the way, currently we have 4202 packages built successfully, with 120 failed which is leading to 582 unresolvable. Remember this is for a full openSUSE Factory (12.2) build. Not bad, but we still have a way to go if we want to have an ARM port ready for 12.2‚Ä≤s release ‚Äì yes that is our hope and intention. Some of those packages that have built successfully still need tweaking, as an example mkinitrd and perl-Bootloader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has also been a change to the internal native build farm. This was what had been set up with the sponsored hardware to do a parralel build of Factory to verify that QEMU was indeed doing the job properly. It was previously setup using an development OBS instance for speed and as a proof of concept really. The internal native ARM build farm has now been moved to the IBS, this is the internal production instance that is used to many of SUSE‚Äôs products. One of the advantages is that is has very good performance including uptime and is pretty stable compared to the sometimes unstable development instance that was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for this move to be made possible is that the team working on the ARM port have been able to sufficiently show that it is possible to build almost the complete distro for the ARM architecture and that it is maintainable. It is still &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; an official port and as such there is no commitment to make it an official product, but (yes there‚Äôs always a but :-) ) it is a good showing that we are sufficiently advanced and that there is little holding us back, including dropping the many dirty hacks that were put in place to get things going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the uptime and performance advantage, moving to IBS also allows other interested developers within SUSE‚Äôs network to quickly check out builds, submit patches or debug things on native hardware. It is still requested that submissions are made against the delopment projects within OBS but this way people can test there submissions before they get pushed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the advancements since last time is that we now have working Kiwi based images for both the Pandaboard and Efika MX Smartbooks/Smarttops. The Efika images even have working graphics and sound o/ We are still working on ironing out the build failures which will clear the unresolvable backlog slowly but surely. there will still be some packages that need deeper fixes, but they shall be conquered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn‚Äôt all rosey though, that would be boring. Several things are still outstanding (apart from fixing packages), we still have no integration with the distribution and there are plenty of issues with hardware-near items, so we have plenty of work to do. Saying that though there are more people joining in the fray using not only hardware that we have but also using their own ARM hardware to get some of the latter fixed. Part of the issue with hardware-near components is the state of the ARM kernel, each SoC still needs its own kernel until Device Tree is ready. So we don‚Äôt plan on sitting back and sleeping, but more help is always welcome ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable wider access to building on ARM there are several initiatives underway, one of them is to wait for the new Cortex-A15 based SoCs which will have full hardware support for the likes of KVM; but that‚Äôs still a few months away before the first boards are available so other options are being investigated. Once something has been found and works hopefully we can have native arm builds on the OBS, but as I said that is still on the horizon and is a mid term goal at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this would not have been possible without the very kind sponsorship of devices from Genesi, Pandaboard.org/Texas Instruments, ARM and the openSUSE community. Also the hard work of the many members of our community; I‚Äôm going to try and name a few here and it is by no means an exhaustive list of people ‚Äì Alex Graf, Adrian Schroeter, Dirk Muller, Marcus Schaefer, Bernhard Wiedemann, Michal Hruseky, Joop Boonen, Andreas Farber, Reinhard Max, Uli Hecht, Matthias Eckermann, Torsten Duwe and Tomas Cech. We have also had a load of help from engineers of Genesi themselves, ST-Ericsson, Linaro and also we would not have been able to get so far without much of the work that Ubuntu, Mer and Fedora have done. On behalf of the wider openSUSE Community, thank you to all of you!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been almost a month since the last ARM porting update so here‚Äôs a little christmas present to you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dirk M√ºller¬†&lt;a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm/2011-12/msg00017.html"&gt;sent&lt;/a&gt;¬†out a status update to the mailing list, but I thought it would be a good idea post here for you scoundrels that aren‚Äôt subscribed :-) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to some great work by loads of people including (but not limited to) Alex Graf, Adrian Schr√∂ter, Dirk M√ºller, Marcus Sch√§fer, Joop Boonen openSUSE‚Äôs ARM port has come along nicely. ¬†We are now at about 4200 successful packages out of a total of around 4700 for a complete distro, an increase of roughly 700 packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some localised issues for ARM but they are much much fewer than before. As we are building against Factory we naturally are affected by Factory‚Äôs occaisional desire to break for the sake of breaking, but again those breakages are realtively few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus has managed to get Kiwi support to build ARM images (with a patch or two from Joop); Kiwi can run on Pandaboards, and also generate suitable images for for Pandaboards ‚Äì the other boards and devices will come later. Alex, Dirk and Adrian have been busy beavering away as usual with package fixes, improvements to qemu and general OBS tweaks; they have also got the internal ARM OBS instance into a great shape, this is distributed between the N√ºrnberg and Prague offices and the nodes comprise of EfikaMX, Pandaboard &amp;amp; Beagleboard. It basically builds factory in parrelel to the public OBS but generally is more successful due to running on native hardware, whereas the public instance uses qemu which sometimes doesn‚Äôt want to play nicely in the playground; we (well OK Alex) can then look at getting a fix for qemu or we import the succesful package into the OBS can move on. I‚Äôm still battling with kernels for the Snowball, but I think I‚Äôm almost there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the bigger issues we have is that there is no graphics support, if you think graphics issues on x86 based systems is a pain wait till you look at it on ARM! ;-) This is being worked on so it‚Äôs just a matter of time, there are ways and means around it but they are far from elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As everyone likes videos, Joop has created another great¬†&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7iG06hJzGI"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;¬†showing openSUSE running on a Pandaboard (Joop uses one of those aforementioned ways &amp;amp; means to get graphics working) and Michal Hru≈°eck√Ω has a¬†&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/113898425601074911439/posts/2DmvCRCWCyP?hl=en-GB"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;¬†showing openSUSE on his Asus Transformer Tablet (yes it‚Äôs still in a chroot but look at that ncurses yummyness :-) )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to remind you that you will be able to see first hand some of the ARM porting goodness at FOSDEM in Febuary so make sure you come along ;-) Till the next update, have a fun and Geeko filled time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased to announce that ARM Holdings has joined our current sponsors, by providing a pile of Texas instruments OMAP4430 powered¬†&lt;a href="http://pandaboard.org/" title="Ti based Pandaboard"&gt;Pandaboards&lt;/a&gt;¬†and some Samsung Exynos4210 powered¬†&lt;a href="http://www.origenboard.org/" title="Samsung powered Origen boards"&gt;Origen boards&lt;/a&gt;! Many thanks to the fine folks in Cambridge for their most generous donation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, thanks to the community‚Äôs donations, we have also obtained an ST-Ericsson Nova A9500 powered¬†&lt;a href="http://igloocommunity.org/" title="ST-Ericsson powered Snowball board"&gt;Snowball board&lt;/a&gt;. Huge thanks to everyone that has made this happen. I know we originally were aiming for Pandaboards, but we need to make sure we aren‚Äôt leaving anyone out. Saying that we still need some more, so don‚Äôt stop helping out (please).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are cracking on with getting things working, and even have openSUSE running natively on a few devices, although there are some very rough edges at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry that no news has been dished out with regards to the openSUSE ARM porting effort, but that‚Äôs mostly because things have been busy (honest!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters we have now successfully built around 3500 packages out of a total of about 4700 for the full openSUSE ditribution. So we are well on our way. It hasn‚Äôt been easy going though, and we still have lots of hurdles, hoops and obstacles to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Graf has been beavering away into the small wee hours getting among things lots of fixes into qemu to help with builds, fixing kernel builds that I and Adrian Schroeter created, and generally being an engineering machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned Adrian Schroeter has been busy with creating as generic a kernel as possible to be used in the OBS with qemu. He has also been busy fixing packages in association with Dirk Mueller, Reinhard Max and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joop Boonen built u-boot and submitted it into the relevant devel project. So we now have the means to properly boot an ARM based system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been busy building hardware specific kernels, which I‚Äôm still learning how to do properly. As it stands we have kernels built for Freescale powered EfikaMXs, Texas Instruments powered Pandboards &amp;amp; Beagleboards, Nvidia powered Tegra2 devices (mainly Trimslice) and soon ST-Ericsson powered NovaThor devices like the Snowball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is still on going, one really good thing is Kiwi support for ARM is being worked on. Marcus Schaefer has rolled his sleeves up and is attacking it with gusto, and making good progress. It is by no means a done deal, yet. It does show though how versatile openSUSE‚Äôs toolsets are. Hopefully it won‚Äôt be too long until we can get things working, and hey maybe even get those fine folks in SUSE Studio to add ARM as an architecture so that we can have highly customised ARM builds :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I also mentioned, the kernels aren‚Äôt perfect yet. So we still need to do more testing and fine tuning. One item that was identified (by Alex of course) was that we have an issue with unwinding. There is a ‚Äúhack‚Äù identified to get things working but a proper fix is still being sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have some exception handling issues which prevents us from builing Java and Java related apps which in turn are preventing us from building a lot of the remaining 1200 or so packages. We do still have some packages that need fixing which don‚Äôt require any of the exception crippled packages, so feel free to jump in ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some areas that still need some love on ARM, like hwinfo and also our darling YaST. X drivers are also a bit of a grey area, actually they‚Äôre more likely to be missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all we still have our work cut out for us, but we are making good progress. ¬†I can‚Äôt say when we will have working images for people to try, so don‚Äôt ask; but trust me, I will make sure to let you all know when we do. I am hoping to have something working in time for FOSDEM and hopefully show it off there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to give you an idea of what we are using the hardware that has been donated so far: EfikaMXs are currently employed natively building packages, one of the issues we have with qemu is that it can be tempremental at times and isn‚Äôt suited really as a long term solution as it stands. So the EfikaMXs build all the the failed packages to make sure that qemu isn‚Äôt at fault ‚Äì we found a load of packages built, and as such were imported into the OBS to get things rolling on. They are also being used to help out with Kiwi support. Pandaboards are being used for testing and bug hunting mostly, but also for packaging. There is also one device of each type for kernel testing/tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you‚Äôre interested and aren‚Äôt afraid of getting your hands dirty (or occaisionally burnt) do join in. Jump on IRC (#opensuse-arm on freenode) and let‚Äôs have fun together. ¬†Oh and don‚Äôt forget this is a community effort and as such we still need a bit more¬†&lt;a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16098" title="openSUSE ARM hardware pledge"&gt;funding&lt;/a&gt;¬†to get some more devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those that aren‚Äôt subscribed to the openSUSE Project Mailinglist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was¬†&lt;a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-10/msg00126.html" title="Announcing the openSUSE Board Election 2011"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;¬†last month, the Board is looking for some new blood. As such I intend to run for one of the available seats. Yes people, your lovable FunkyPenguin is hoping to be able to represent you and all your crazy ideas (I‚Äôve got some of those myself ;-) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know of a few other candidates that are running, and they‚Äôre fine upstanding folk of the openSUSE community. I believe you should think long and hard about who you would like to represent you. ¬†The Board is in place for you, the community, and as such it is up to you to say whom you would like to represent you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that don‚Äôt know me: I‚Äôm known as FunkyPenguin on IRC, I often wear a kilt, I‚Äôve been a contributor to openSUSE for at least five years and been a user for much much longer. As part of my contributions I was very active in the GNOME team, I helped to bring the now defunct MeeGo UI to openSUSE, and lately I‚Äôm helping to port openSUSE to ARM, as well as general packaging of bits and bobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a fairly no-nonsense kind of chap, and I will say things as I see them (I will endeavour to ensure I take people‚Äôs sensibilities into account too). I also like to believe I‚Äôm an approachable person, so if you want to speak to me off the grid then that‚Äôs fine too, although I do prefer open communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for now in the words of Porky Pig, that‚Äôs all folks! I‚Äôll be speaking to you (and hopefully not at you) soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The big update is that a couple of kind companies have stepped up and sponsored some hardware for the effort to get openSUSE on ARM. Huge thank you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.genesi-tech.com/" title="Makers of the EfikaMX range"&gt;&lt;img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/thumb/4/43/Genesi_logo.png/200px-Genesi_logo.png" alt="Genesi Logo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have kindly sponsored and shipped several¬†&lt;a href="http://www.genesi-tech.com/products" title="EfikaMX Smarttops and Smartbooks"&gt;EfikaMX&lt;/a&gt;¬†devices. Thanks to Peter Czanik for organising this on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandaboard.org"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandaboard.org/sites/default/files/danland_logo.png" alt="Ti based PandaBoard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ti in association with the PandaBoard community have kindly sponsored and are shipping several PandaBoards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, this is a huge help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have some devices on our way it doesn‚Äôt mean we can sit back and relax, we still need more devices. Yes, I‚Äôm going to say it again ‚Äì Please help the Geeko and donate as much or as little as you can (preferably not zero ;-) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/16098"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/16098.png?skin_name=chrome" alt="Click here to lend your support to: openSUSE ARM Hardware and make a donation at www.pledgie.com !"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what else is new? Well openSUSE has managed to run on a couple of modern ARM devices. Joop Boonen¬†&lt;a href="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/16098.png?skin_name=chrome"&gt;managed&lt;/a&gt;¬†to get openSUSE running on his PandaBoard. He even made a couple of videos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf5zKT2gWKs" title="First boot of openSUSE on a Pandaboard"&gt;First boot of openSUSE ARM port on Pandaboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michal Hru≈°eck√Ω¬†&lt;a href="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/10/opensuse-asus-transformer/" title="Meet Optimus Geeko"&gt;managed&lt;/a&gt;¬†to get openSUSE running on his ASUS Transformer Tablet (albeit in a chroot), he has also provided¬†&lt;a href="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/10/opensuse-arm-chroot-less-then-alpha/" title="Pre-Alpha Geeko chroot"&gt;information&lt;/a&gt;¬†on how to do this yourself if you‚Äôre feeling brave :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still don‚Äôt have anything that we can release yet, as we are still working to fix packages. We are fighting forward and we will succeed!!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So HackWeek VII has been and gone, but work has not stopped in getting our beloved Geeko some ARMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I‚Äôll be the first to admit, things have been a wee bit scrappy in places. This isn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs just that we want to get things rolling ASAP. Thing is, we need more haste less speed; we need to be somewhat more concerted with our efforts. So instead of trying to get everything to build in one hit (would be great if that was possible), we are going to target patterns of packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind Joop Boonen was good enough to pull up a list of the packages required to build the Jeos pattern, I‚Äôve added it to the¬†&lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Jeos_ARM_Package_List" title="Jeos ARM package list"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;¬†in a table to show the status of the required packages. If you would like to help out, look at the the¬†&lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Jeos_ARM_Package_List" title="Jeos package list"&gt;Jeos Package List page&lt;/a&gt;¬†and add your name in the column and when you submit a fix pop the SR number in too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have the Jeos list complete, we can then move on as each subsequent package set will build on this. Next up will be the Minimal X, after that we get onto the big bad boys of GNOME/KDE/LXDE/XFCE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One item that is holding us back is hardware ‚Äì we are encountering a whole heap of issues with Qemu, which takes time to resolve and as such takes time away from getting things working. So please help us out by donating as much or as little as you can to the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I¬†&lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/09/30/target-arm-hardware.html" title="Target ARM hardware decision"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt;¬†before, we have an initial target platform identified for testing the work of all those involved in the openSUSE ARM port. The problem is we need to obtain the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in discussions trying to get some corporate sponsorship of hardware, but we can not rely soley on those kind companies that would like to see us succeed. We as a community need to help ourselves succeed, as such I‚Äôve set up a¬†&lt;a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16098" title="openSUSE ARM pledgie campaign"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;¬†on Pledgie to enable us the community to contribute to the effort for obtaining hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these funds, we the community will be able to purchase 5 (maybe more) PandaBoards which will help developers fix packages and also test the port to ensure everything works. Until the new ARM based chipsets are released, which could be the middle of next year, we will also need a substantial number of boards to provide a decent enough amount of compute power for OBS to build natively. ¬†OBS is great, but there are limitations with emulating the environment in Qemu. Having physical hardware will remove these limitations and enable us to prove that openSUSE is a world class ARM distirbution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please help us to help you, donate what you can so that we can reach our goal of ‚Ç¨1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just sent this into the¬†&lt;a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm" title="openSUSE ARM Mailing list"&gt;-arm mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hot topic, and one that seems to generate the most noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve had a discussion with several people about target hardware, and I‚Äôve also looked at what our peers are doing and saying. At the same time I‚Äôve been trying to see what options we have for getting some sponsorship for hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three devices in the running, all are classed as development boards ‚Äì so no case or external prettyness (beauty comes from within anyway):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pandaboard.org/" title="TI's PanadaBoard"&gt;TI PandaBoard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.origenboard.org/" title="Samsung's Origen Board"&gt;Samsung Origen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.igloocommunity.org/" title="ST Ericsson's Snowball Board"&gt;ST Ericsson Snowball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discussing, the preferred nominee is the PandaBoard. Several factors led to this decision, it has an integrated wired network connection; is well supported by the incumbant distros; widely used within the wider ARM open source community; and it has Pandas (OK only in name but still!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to prep and get some hardware, then go for the PandaBoard (as soon as the Cortex A15 is released, we‚Äôll be looking at them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know it‚Äôs a developer board and not an end user product. Unfortunately there aren‚Äôt actually that many end user products that you can sensibly use for development at the moment. Sure, there‚Äôs the¬†&lt;a href="http://trimslice.com/" title="Tegra2 powered "Desktop""&gt;TrimSlice&lt;/a&gt;the¬†&lt;a href="http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/t-dreamplugdetails.aspx" title="Plug Computer"&gt;DreamPlug&lt;/a&gt;¬†and a few others, but after consulting someone that is far more knowledgable and aware of the wider landscape, we went with their recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and things are moving pretty fast folk!! o/&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/09/22/growing-some-opensuse-arms.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things that came out of the recent¬†&lt;a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/" title="oSC11"&gt;Geeko Love-In&lt;/a&gt;¬†for me was a new project to immerse myself in within openSUSE. Yeah I know, we have enough existing projects already so why create a new one? Simples! Believe it or not but openSUSE is behind the curve in a specific segment, and that segment has yet to explode to its full potential. That segment is ARM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/ARM_powered_Badge.svg/220px-ARM_powered_Badge.svg.png" alt="ARM Logo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No I‚Äôm not talking about your upper body appendages, but the architecture that powers most of your little devices (and some bigger ones too). Almost all smartphones, tablets and many other consumer devices are powered by ARM from one of the numerous licensees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn‚Äôt openSUSE do something about this a while ago? Yes we did. Unfortunately the effort seems to have bitrotted somewhat, there were numerous reasons and I don‚Äôt even prophesise to know the all either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such I‚Äôm going to try and kickstart things, and see it through and hopefully see it grow. ¬†As I mentioned, this idea came up at the conference when I was talking to numerous people (I forget how it all started, but that doesn‚Äôt really matter). There was an overwhelmingly positive view on the matter, and that for me was all that counts. Now let me be crystal clear here, &lt;em&gt;THIS WILL NOT BE A ONE MAN SHOW!!&lt;/em&gt; I mentioned previously that my view is that we as a community are pretty lazy at times with getting our hands dirty. As such if you think things are going slow or not going in the direction you would like, don‚Äôt moan. Get your hands dirty and help make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process will not be an easy one either, so don‚Äôt expect a port to magically appear over night. If we‚Äôre lucky we might be able to have a working port in 6 months. Maybe longer, maybe shorter; ultimately that lies with us as a community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage one has begun already thanks to Adrian Schroeter, Alex Graf and Dirk Mueller. Stage one comprises of getting the boot strap process to work. At a cursory level this means getting the packages required for setting up a build chroot environment and for building these packages on the target ARM architecture. This will possibly take a fair amount of time, and no I won‚Äôt give any timelines for this ‚Äì how long is a piece of string?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;openSUSE has a couple of advantages here, 1) we have the OBS which can cross build and if need be cross compile packages for numerous architectures (ARM included) so we are going to make a start with that; 2) SUSE are going to be doing another HackWeek (I think it is next week) which means Adrian, Alex, Dirk and anyone else that has knowledge, experience or interest can join in the fun and pain almost full time for a week ‚Äì let‚Äôs not kid ourselves here there is a high probability for lots of pain, but also fun ;-) Thing is HackWeek is not just for SUSE staff, it is also for the community. You can join in and spend some quality time on the project with those that know a whole heap of stuff, and learn from them and maybe even teach them something too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to be targeting ARMv7 nothing older I‚Äôm afraid this means CORTEX-A8 and above (looking at A9 primarily and then the new A15 when it‚Äôs available), it gets too messy otherwise and it is already messy enough.If you have knowledge and experience, please help out. If you don‚Äôt take part you have no justification to complain ‚Äì you‚Äôve got to be in it to win it ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôm basically just giving you all a heads up on this effort, and will update you as regularily as possible (I‚Äôm hoping to do something weekly maybe). In the meantime, if you‚Äôre interested join¬†&lt;a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-arm" title="openSUSE ARM IRC channel"&gt;#opensuse-arm&lt;/a&gt;¬†on Freenode and the¬†&lt;a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm" title="openSUSE ARM Mailing List"&gt;opensuse-arm&lt;/a&gt;¬†mailing list. &lt;em&gt;DO NOT HARRASS&lt;/em&gt; for updates, if there is something to say it will be said. If you‚Äôve got a question, ask and *WAIT* for an answer. If you want to help out but want to know how ask and &lt;strong&gt;*WAIT\&lt;/strong&gt;* for an answer. I will try and get something on the wiki soon, with a todo list etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks and here‚Äôs to getting our Geeko some ARMs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the good times have come to an end, one of the best shindig in a long time has been and gone. Friends from far away have returned home, as have I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the openSUSE Conference of 2011 was an absolute blast. Seriously, I had an absolute scream. As I mentioned¬†&lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/08/30/what-the-opensuse-conference-means-to-me.html" title="What the openSUSE Conference means to me"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;¬†I was expecting a whole heap of fun, and boy did the Geeko deliver!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met up with all sorts of people, starting off with Richard Brown a.k.a. Ilmehtar at Gatwick airport (I didn‚Äôt actually realised that Richard was Ilmehtar until about day 1 or 2 of the conference), oh and Michael Meeks. We pitched up at the hotel, checked in, dumped our bags and went straight to the venue to help sort stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we didn‚Äôt have to do much sorting out as those Thirsty Thirteen (you may know them as the Fabulous Booster Boys) had turned the derilect building into a fantastic conference venue. Not entirely on their own, they did have some help from a bunch of Greeks, some Swiss and some stray Brazilian (love you Izabel ;-) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst catching up with some of the folk that were there on the Saturday, I got one of the best surprises that the Geeko could give me ‚Äì I met up with a bunch of guys from Taiwan. Why would meeting a bunch of Taiwanese be so cool? Simples! These were some of the super heros that helped me fix, patch, kick and roll out Smeegol. With out their help and encouragement I doubt I would have survived. They are a cool and crazy ¬†bunch of guys, and I am¬†&lt;strong&gt;SO¬†&lt;/strong&gt;happy to have met them in the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about the conference was the crate load of Old Toad, openSUSE‚Äôs own beer. Not only did I drink plenty, but *everyone* drank plenty. The beer wasn‚Äôt given away, near enough but not quite ‚Äì each beer was ‚Ç¨1 which goes back into the geeko bank to help finance future community efforts. I‚Äôve no idea on how much was generated but I‚Äôm confident that we smashed through a four figure sum :-) The only touristy thing I did this year was take a little tour with Uncle Klaas (dragotin to his fellow geekos), and about 20 or so other like minded thirsty Geekos. Uncle Klaas took us to the home of Old Toad, and got us a tour of the lovely little brewery that helped make the fine beverage. We sampled some fine beers (yes Pascal, they were actually pretty good even in comparison to the holy belgian fluid ;-) ), followed by some great food and as always we had excellent company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference itself had some good talks, some of them were very technical, some of them struck a good balance, and others were totally non-technical ‚Äì all in all a great mix, something for everyone. I‚Äôd just like to thank all the SUSE Labs guys and gals for joining us and making it one big happy family ![:-)][3] I‚Äôve always thought of the Labs folk as kind of ‚ÄòBlack Ops‚Äô sorta people, you know the type ‚Äì ‚Äúoh I could tell you what I do but then I‚Äôd have to kill you‚Äù. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Well, not¬†&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;¬†close at least :-P ¬†Sure they‚Äôre clever peeps, but they‚Äôre also very human and lovers of all Geekos. Next time you see one of them, take a leaf out of Jos‚Äô or Pavol‚Äôs book and give them a hug ‚Äì you may need to ask first as they may think you‚Äôre trying to steal their latest crazy idea ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs see did I forget any other fun bits? Oh, I did indeed. There was the Conference evening party, where we had a fine specimen of a beast (sorry Henne but that mechanical bull was hawt!!). The outside seating area was partially transformed into a Western style ranch with poker tables, and yes a mechanical bull ‚Äì I believe the night‚Äôs record was for 71seconds or so. The food was great, and I‚Äôd like to thank the local butcher/caterers for some great grub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs not all, I also had the pleasure of attending Michael Willmer‚Äôs keynote. For those that don‚Äôt know Michael is the ‚ÄòVP of Marketing and Global Alliances‚Äô at SUSE. He‚Äôs an Attachmate veteran, and he‚Äôs a suit.&lt;strong&gt;BUT‚Ä¶¬†&lt;/strong&gt;And it‚Äôs a pretty huge but. He‚Äôs no ordinary suit, seriously. This is not properganda, it‚Äôs not marketing fluff. It is my own personal take on things. For a senior suit, the man turned up wearing his openSUSE t-shirt. He fired up his laptop and low and behold he‚Äôs running GNOME-shell, sure it was in fallback mode but he is clearly not scared of cuts and bruises from software. He started his presentation and oh look, he‚Äôs not using LO or any other presentation software, no PDF. He created his presentation in Inkscape with the Sozi plugin, and used Chromium as the actual tool to display it all. Just to remind you, Michael Miller is a senior suit at a large US corporation, yeah it‚Äôs kinda tough to connect the two but this is the one and the same. He mingled with the crowd of Geekos afterwards and came back the next day for more Geeko love ‚Äì oh and the obligatory ear bending from some people (not me, honest). I‚Äôm sure the roses will fade, but I‚Äôm quietly confident that there will be more positive than negative from now on. I‚Äôm not saying there wont be any rubbish, there will always be rubbish, just that the amount will be less and how it is handled will hopefully be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I thoroughly loved the conference this year. It was genuinely openSUSE‚Äôs conference as the hard work was done by openSUSE not by corporate drones. ¬†Nothing was dictated, it was decided. I seriously can‚Äôt thank the Boosters enough for their hard physical labour. I‚Äôd also like to thank the conference teams, like those accepting submissions for sessions and the travel sponsorship committee. Also I‚Äôd also like to thank Alexia for tirelessly manning the bar dealing with weird reprobates. I‚Äôd like to thank Jillian and Katie for interpreting for Bryen. These two women aren‚Äôt technical, although they kind of know some of the jargon and acronyms, they didn‚Äôt really understand what they meant. Never the less the did a fine job in interpreting all the Geeko love for Bryen to fully enjoy. Oh and Coolo learnt a new thing from them too :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could end my ramblings on a high, but that wouldn‚Äôt be cricket now ;-) So what was wrong? The simplest thing -¬†&lt;strong&gt;PRINT PEOPLE‚ÄôS IRC NICKNAMES WITH THEIR NAMES ON THE BADGES!!!¬†&lt;/strong&gt; Seriosuly, this is something that has been asked for at each conference. Kindly do it for the next one, please. That‚Äôs an easy fix, the next one isn‚Äôt so easy. We have a great and vibrant community. we have lots of clever people (yes, we do also have some stupid people), problem is we don‚Äôt interact well with speakers and presenters. Seriously, we suck in that respect. I‚Äôm not saying I want to see and hear hecklers at the next conference, but if a presenter asks for audience participation bloddy well participate!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know this post is a bit dry on eye candy, but I genuinely didn‚Äôt many photos, and those that I did take were utter rubbish. So I shall link so some other Geeko‚Äôs photos instead:&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was asked the other day ‚ÄúWhat do you expect from the openSUSE Conference?‚Äù The simple answer is I only expect to have fun. Seriously, I expect nothing more, nothing less. I hope for a whole lot more, but I certainly don‚Äôt expect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound somewhat silly, but in all honesty that‚Äôs how I feel. This conference (as are most others) is a great way to meet the people you interact with online, ¬†there‚Äôs something satisfying to be able to replace the digital person with a real flesh and blood person. You can thank someone in a real sincere way with a gift (could be a pint or something else) or slap them and let your anger out. Digital is pretty good, but having the physical is always better once in a while :-D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I take the original question and rephrase it to ‚ÄúWhat do you hope for from the openSUSE Conference?‚Äù then my answer at least for this year would be something along these lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about some of the technology that powers openSUSE and that openSUSE provides ‚Äì for me this is predominantly the sessions on Packaging and KVM but there are so many I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll be able to get to them all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make some new friends. This might sound a bit sad, but let‚Äôs be honest these events beat the crap out of any social network whether it‚Äôs Facebook, Google or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this year includes the SUSE Labs guys &amp;amp; gals, I‚Äôm hoping to speak to several SUSE folk about ways to expand SUSE within my employer. We have numerous new initiatives that hopefully can be of benefit to both parties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got a published session on the 5Ws of openSUSE contribution, which I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the audience get involved with. ¬†I‚Äôm also going to hold a BoF on Bongo‚Äôs WebUI and as I‚Äôm about as artistic as a fart in a space suit I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day the conference is what you make of it, so if you want a great conference come along and in the words of some futuristic Frenchman ‚ÄúMake it so!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to be holding a Bof at the openSUSE Conference all about the 5 Ws of contributing to openSUSE. WTF is it about? Well I‚Äôm glad you asked (I don‚Äôt care if you didn‚Äôt ask, because I‚Äôm going to tell you anyway ;-) )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intention is to have as interactive a session possible, I will take on the role of comp√®re and with audience participation I will try and highlight where we have issues both as a project and as a contributor and try and get to some form of resolution even if it is just a plan not an actual fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what on earth are the 5 Ws? Well they are Who (would contribute), Why (they would contribute), hoW (they can contribute), What (they would contribute), Where (they would contribute). I would also like to talk about the tools that are available for contribution and how they can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key factor to this BoF session is audience participation, with out you the community it will be pointless. I want to see old hands and new blood at the session, and be honest. If you have a grievence then air it, if you feel there is a blocker let us know. Conversly if you think something is done right let us know, we are too proud a project &amp;amp; community to give ourselves credit. Everyone needs a bit of a pat on the back once in a while &lt;img src="http://conference.opensuse.org/" alt=";-)" title="openSUSE Conference 2011"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please come along and join in the discussion :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/07/15/designing-the-missing-web-ui-for-bongo.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/rwx3b-300x123.png" alt="oSC11 logo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay openSUSE is having a shindig in September, yes it‚Äôs the &lt;a href="http://conference.opensuse.org" title="oSC11 homepage"&gt;openSUSE Conference 2011 (aka oSC11)&lt;/a&gt;. And seeing as the theme is rwx¬≥ I‚Äôve submitted a couple of BoF propossals. ¬†Now they haven‚Äôt been approved yet, so I‚Äôm not 100% sure they‚Äôll happen but either way I‚Äôll be there and will be keen to talk to anyone that is interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first topic I‚Äôd like to talk about is as the post‚Äôs subject says ‚ÄúDesigning the missing Web UI for Bongo‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For un-aware the &lt;a href="http://bongo-project.org" title="Bongo project homepage"&gt;Bongo&lt;/a&gt; is an e-mail &amp;amp; calendaring solution that can trace its roots back to Netmail. It is directly descended from Hula, which was a proof of concept email &amp;amp; calendaring solution which had such luminary hackers such as Dave Camp, Peter Teichman, Nat Friedman, Garrett Le Sage and many others. ¬†Unfortunately due to commercial and other management decisions Hula was terminated. Yes it was honestly cool, and as a PoC it actually worked. Thankfully it was an open source project and was forked just before the door was closed, into the Bongo project. As part of the code clean up and ongoing development the existing UI had to be dropped due to code complexity, size and lack of resources for maintaining it. Which leads us to where we are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have now is a MTA backend that can be distributed over multiple servers or combined on a single machine. It‚Äôs pretty light weight and works. We support the usual protocols, so IMAP (with or without TLS/SSL), POP3, SMTP (currently we‚Äôve had to disable outgoing TLS/SSL due to a bug), CalDAV (albeit in a simple form), anti-virus support for clamav, and anti-spam support with spamassassin. So the foundation blocks are there in place, all we‚Äôre missing is the shiny frontend beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear Bongo is not aimed at the ‚ÄúGroupware‚Äù market, so it isn‚Äôt aiming to compete with the likes of Zimbra, Exchange, Domino, GroupWise, OpenXchange etc. It is aimed at those that don‚Äôt require the bloat that comes with those big products, those that want a simple clean way to deal with e-mail and calendaring. A competitor could be viewed as Gmail Google Calendar, but self hosted at home/office or hosted as a service. Target audience I suppose could be viewed as individuals/families; SOHO that don‚Äôt need the bloat or intricate understanding of servers like postfix or sendmail with dovecot or similar; educational facilities ‚Äì you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned we have a fairly stable backend that provides email and calendaring, but the only way of interfacing with it is via a fat client (evolution, thunderbird, kmail, etc) ‚Äì I use it at home. What we need is a way of getting to it via a browser. The aim of my BoF proposal is to discuss ways of meeting that requirement, what technologies could and maybe should be used, going through pros &amp;amp; cons and getting people interested in e-mail &amp;amp; calendaring and web design involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a project we have some ideas on technologies used, but at the end of the day this whole web joojoo is kind of out of developer‚Äôs field, so if one of you hipster hackers has a better idea and implements it then who are we to argue ;-) As an example we kind of like the idea of HTML5 but we don‚Äôt have to be limited to that, at the end of the day we want a clean simple and functional UI ‚Äì both user and admin. We have a blank canvas so anything goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bongo can be a distributed solution it would also be great if the Web UI could be re-used in a way similar to Roundcube or Squirrelmail, Meaning you could use it as a generic web based MUA hooking into almost any mail server. This isn‚Äôt mandatory but a ‚Äúwould be nice to have‚Äù type feature. Initially we would be looking at something that provides core functionality ‚Äì email, calendaring &amp;amp; contacts ‚Äì but can be extended via a plugin system maybe. Again that‚Äôs just a thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we can get some real traction going and maybe after the BoF we can start to do some hacking on it :-) It would be absolutely awesome if by the end of the conference we had the beginings of a beautiful product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please &lt;a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/confRegistrationFormDisplay.py?confId=2" title="oSC11 registration page"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; for the conference and join in the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2011-05-19T23:00:00Z</published>

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/05/20/can-we-spread-the-isv-love-please.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So word from the new Big Cheese, Herr Braukmann, is openSUSE is vital to SUSE ‚Äì newsflash, this isn‚Äôt new or surprising ;-) In the same breath SUSE is vital for openSUSE, again nothing new here. One problem though, there are many elements that still see them as void of each other and don‚Äôt trust or believe in the community.¬† Hopefully with the re-organisation this will start to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that SUSE has marketed for a long time is that it has the highest number of ISV software certified to run on their platform. Great! One question though ‚Äì how as an openSUSE user can we help/benefit from this huge number of applications? Well most of the time if you want to use that software you have to build it from source with somewhat outdated documentation, and for the rest of the time you just plain can‚Äôt use it as they don‚Äôt make things easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know life would be boring if it was easy. But does it need to be this difficult?! In a word ‚Äì NO. Let‚Äôs not forget, we have the spiffy knock your socks off Open Build Service, so why not get them built in there and share the love for all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the ISV may not want freeloaders using their products, they want money so naturally want you to buy the product. That washes for some ISVs, but not all. There are many that have a Community Edition or similar, which is ideal for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would openSUSE users want any of that bloated corporate rubbish? Well I would like easy access to some of it for testing and maybe even using.¬† Officially SLES is my employer‚Äôs preferred distro, so being able to quickly and easily knock up a test instance would be great.¬† Also it works to the ISV‚Äôs advantage, they get exposure. Most geeks are curious, and if they professionally have to deal with Linux they tend to be very curious. If a new product comes out that plays buzzword bingo, a CTO or similar will want the new shiny, so as responsible geeks it‚Äôs our duty to be able to slap the suit back down and tell him the real truth about the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to see packages from the likes of Alfresco, OpenBravo, Zimbra etc. available for us to use and test. So any chance some of the SUSE suits that deal with ISVs can help out?¬† Many of these products leverage Tomcat, and my packaging skills with the cat aren‚Äôt that good (actually almost non-existant :-) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an area where we lack and one of our competitors spanks us ‚Äì Ubuntu has a partner repository that enables many of these types of productsto be installed by users. We must match this, and then once we have matched it we must better it. We don‚Äôt want to be spanked, we want to spank others!! (the spanking thing worked in my head, so I‚Äôm going with it ![:-)][2] )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So any chance of any help from anyone?!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post to enlighten those that use an Intel 945GME powered machine of a certain pixel limitation that you may not know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a full time user of the spiffy new GNOME3 with the fancy gnome-shell mojo. As such it‚Äôs on my primary machine, which at the moment is an eeePC 1000HE. Yup, that‚Äôs a netbook with a small 10‚Ä≥ screen and relatively low resolution of 1024√ó600 pixels. ¬†As I‚Äôm sat at my desk I thought I would use my 17‚Ä≥ Dell LCD monitor. So I plugged it in and selected ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;System Settings&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt;Displays&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò Without any issue it saw my external monitor and allowed me to enable it. I chose not to mirror displays as I‚Äôd like to take advantage of the larger screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POOF!!&lt;/strong&gt;¬†:-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My CPU was getting spanked by gnome-shell, everything was grinding to a halt. I tried logging out and back in, but still my CPU was being pummeled. I tried rebooting, but that didn‚Äôt change the hammering that my poor Atom was getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked the resident crazy Frenchman, no not Vincent but his compatriot in crime, Frederic. He wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a bug or not, so advised to ask in #gnome-shell on IRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off I clicked to IRC, and pretty much as soon as I asked my question ‚Äì I had an answer from about three people; and they were all useful responses. Thankfully Emmanuelle gave me the clear answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 945GME can only push a maximum of 2048√ó2048 pixels, so my setup was just too many pixels for it ‚Äì 1024√ó600 1280√ó1024 = 2308√ó1624. Either I mirror my displays; lower the resolution on my external monitor; or disable the internal display (this is what I‚Äôve chosen for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, the Intel 945GME has a limit of 2048√ó2048 pixels. No maybes, ifs, or buts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some people may have noticed that I‚Äôve been fairly quiet on the Geeko front, this has been mainly down to an insane amount of work but also some other bits and bobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of those bits and bobs are a result of my mind running away with me, I like to believe that I‚Äôm a good thinker, some people say I‚Äôm a daydreamer, others say I have an over active imagination. Personally I reckon they‚Äôre all correct :-D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has a downside though of loosing focus. ¬†If I was a business I would be bust or very close to going bust, as I no longer have sight of my core product and am trying to enter new markets with half hearted products that aren‚Äôt of any use to anybody. So something has to change, and as such I‚Äôm looking at trying to calm down and regain focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously focus wasn‚Äôt that difficult ‚Äì after all I was charging around getting dear old Smeegol out. That was no simple task and was hugely enjoyable even though many things would really tick me off. ¬†My pet project that I intended on doing was that little bit too crazy even for me, mainly because my C and Android knowledge isn‚Äôt up to the task, no development experience of LibreOffice and not a huge amount f spare time. ¬†As such I‚Äôm not going to be going forward with this. ¬†Luckily thanks to those kind folk at Google, LibreOffice has been accepted into GSOC and I believe this is one of the projects that will be mentored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also looking at getting MeeGo‚Äôs new Tablet UI built on openSUSE, unfortunately I don‚Äôt really have the heart at the moment for this for some reason, and I‚Äôm not entirely sure I‚Äôm prepared for the massive amounts of pain involved. ¬†Oh, and as a minor item I don‚Äôt have any hardware to dogfood with. So I‚Äôm shelving this idea too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to try and go back to roots, which means chipping in and helping out with the GNOME team, after all we can‚Äôt have it dominated by the French and Swiss now can we? ¬†I am also lucky enough to be a co-mentor for GSOC in getting Entomologist better. ¬†So this is something that I‚Äôm looking forward to ‚Äì hopefully I get to slowly and comfortably get better with Android and C ;-) ¬†I also want to try and blog a bit more.¬†I was hoping to be able to do some items as part of my job around Spacewalk and other bits, but unfortunately this hasn‚Äôt materialised :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôm going to try and focus any spare time on these two items, if anyone sees me do otherwise please slap me and remind me what it is I‚Äôm supposed to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download entomologist from the¬†&lt;a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=net.forcev.Entomologist&amp;amp;feature=search_result" title="Open source cross platform bug tracking client for Android"&gt;Android Market&lt;/a&gt;, or if you don‚Äôt have access to the Market you can grab the¬†&lt;a href="http://entomologist.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=entomologist/entomologist;a=blob;f=android/bin/Entomologist-release.apk;h=7c867122839395ca5250760d51972cda9d19d942;hb=HEAD" title="Manually install entomologist"&gt;.apk&lt;/a&gt;. When you launch it for the first time it checks to see if you have the required Qt libraries, if not it will ask you to install¬†&lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/necessitas/ministro/home/" title="Qt libraries for Android"&gt;Ministro&lt;/a&gt;¬†(if not already installed) from the Market (grab the&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ministro.necessitas.p/files/Ministro-1.0.apk/download" title="Manually install Ministro"&gt;.apk&lt;/a&gt;¬†if you don‚Äôt have the Market), once installed it then grabs the required libraries ‚Äì probably best to be on a wifi connection rather than cellular just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the UI isn‚Äôt the best for mobiles ‚Äì it works fairly well on my GalaxyTab thanks to the large screen &amp;amp; higher resolution. Reason for releasing now is so people can contribute ideas/code/bugs/etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any UI designers bored and fancy a little piece of fun, then please join in ‚Äì I‚Äôm not looking at anyone in particular,¬†&lt;a href="http://linuxart.com/log/" title="LeSage's easel"&gt;Mr LeSage&lt;/a&gt;¬†&amp;amp;¬†&lt;a href="http://andy.fitzsimon.com.au/" title="Antipedean Artist in Prague"&gt;Mr Fitzsomon&lt;/a&gt;¬†;-P&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So as I mentioned¬†&lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/03/04/bug-tracking-with-the-help-of-an-entomologist.html" title="Bug Tracking With The Help Of An Entomologist"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt;¬†I managed to port¬†&lt;a href="http://entimologist.sourceforge.net/" title="Entomologist Bug Tracking Client"&gt;entimologist&lt;/a&gt;¬†to Android. This post will hopefully explain how I did this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shopping list for this task is relatively straight forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" title="Android Software Development Kit"&gt;Android SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html" title="Android Native Development Kit"&gt;Android NDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Java development files (on openSUSE I use java-1_6_0-sun-devel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href="http://ant.apache.org/" title="Apache Ant"&gt;ant&lt;/a&gt;¬†(on openSUSE ant is too old, I use the¬†&lt;a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi" title="Grab the latest binary tarball"&gt;binary tarball&lt;/a&gt;¬†from the Apache site)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Qt Creator for Android SDK a.k.a¬†&lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/necessitas/home/" title="Qt Creator for Android"&gt;Necessitas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Not necessary but could be helpful ‚Äì¬†&lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" title="Java IDE"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;¬†(on openSUSE don‚Äôt use the packages available as there are things missing that prevent building for android, use the¬†&lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/heliossr2" title="Grab the binary tarball"&gt;binary tarball&lt;/a&gt;¬†from the Eclipse site)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ministro.necessitas.p/files/" title="Qt libraries for Android"&gt;Ministro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing I had done was install and setup Eclipse, I then setup the Android SDK &amp;amp; Android NDK ‚Äì that was done months ago. See the Android Developer site for good, clear instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For setting up Necessitas, I used Alessandro‚Äôs¬†&lt;a href="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/02/28/necessitas/" title="Clear instructions for Necessitas"&gt;post &amp;amp; video&lt;/a&gt;¬†as a guide, but there are also details on Necessitas‚Äô site. ¬†After following the steps, I couldnt quite get things working, and I was starting to think that GNOME3 and Qt, were being children and bickering. No, they weren‚Äôt. It was me being a dufus! I hadn‚Äôt read the bit about ant needing to be &amp;gt;=1.8.0 :-) Download Ministro to somewhere safe (I popped mine in /opt/necessitas)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to get things to work, I un-installed the ant rpm, extracted the bibnary tarball into ~/bin, and did a¬†&lt;code&gt;sudo ln -s ~/bin/apache-ant-1.8.2/bin/ant /usr/bin/ant&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I wont pretend to know WTF I‚Äôm doing with Qt, as far as I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs another alien language. Problem is I needed to tell Necessitas what Qt libraries entomologist needed, I had no real idea. I had a look at the source and the spec file and got some clues, so I added the ones I thought were needed. I tried a build and got further than previously (now that I had the correct version of ant!). I was now getting some weird missing library error, but I couldn‚Äôt work it out. Along comes our new¬†&lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Boosters_team" title="The Thirsty Thirteen"&gt;Boosters&lt;/a&gt;¬†member¬†&lt;a href="http://namtrac.org/" title="a.k.a cartman or divildivil"&gt;Ismail D√∂nmez&lt;/a&gt;¬†to the rescue. ¬†There will be a lib$APPNAME.so that is created to work out which Qt libraries you need just do a¬†&lt;code&gt;readelf -d ¬†lib$APPNAME.so&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case I did¬†&lt;code&gt;readelf -d libentomologist.so&lt;/code&gt;¬†and got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/workspace/Entomologist-build-android&amp;gt; readelf -d libentomologist.so&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dynamic section at offset 0x4bda8 contains 29 entries:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;¬† Tag ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Type ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Name/Value&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem obvious, but look at the ones that have (NEEDED) in them ;-) I was missing libQtXml.so. Simply add the missing Qt library either by adding it manually in $PROJECT_LOCATION &amp;gt; Other files &amp;gt; android &amp;gt; res &amp;gt; values &amp;gt; libs.xml, or simply tick the required one in Qt Creator by going to the Projects button on the left &amp;gt; Run &amp;gt; Package Configurations &amp;gt; Libraries tab&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When testing your app, make sure you select ‚ÄúInstall Ministro system wide qt shared libraries installer‚Äù from the Projects button on the left &amp;gt; Run &amp;gt; Deploy configurations, then select the .apk in the ‚ÄúChoose apk‚Äù button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that‚Äôs done, hit the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button on the bottom left of Qt Creator and off you go :-) ¬†I appreciate it may seem like a lot of work, but honestly it isn‚Äôt that much. I buggered around for ages cursing, mainly because I hadn‚Äôt checked my version of ant and didnt read the error message being spat out. I also didn‚Äôt know about readelf -d. ¬†All I need to work out and try now is publishing to the Market https://market.android.com/. So all in all have fun and keep being¬†cute¬†Qt :-D&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2011/03/04/bug-tracking-with-the-help-of-an-entomologist.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like to think of myself as being fairly consistent, and I‚Äôve had one request for a long time, a desktop bug tracker client. I even¬†&lt;a href="http://www.wafaa.eu/entry/bugging-bugs---a-call-for-help-1-20.html" title="Help needed for a fat bug tracker"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;¬†¬†if someone more adept in the ways of The Code could help. Unfortunately my call for help wasn‚Äôt heard :-( &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was until¬†&lt;a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/19/hackweek-vi/" title="Novell / openSUSE HackWeek VI"&gt;HackWeek VI&lt;/a&gt;¬†¬†came along! Luckily¬†&lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Mbarringer" title="Znggo the Entomologist"&gt;Matt Barringer&lt;/a&gt;¬†(from those crazy cooks in the¬†&lt;a href="http://susestudio.com/" title="Appliances made easy"&gt;SUSE Studio&lt;/a&gt;¬†team) heard my call. He picked up his code machine gun and blasted away o/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days after HackWeek VI ended he enlightened me to his new masterpiece ‚Äì¬†&lt;a href="http://entomologist.sourceforge.net/" title="Desktop bug tracker client"&gt;Entomologist&lt;/a&gt;. ¬†So what is it? As you may have guessed, it is a desktop bug tracker client. ¬†It‚Äôs cutely written in Qt, isn‚Äôt final yet (is any software?) but works fairly well. ¬†Why only fairly well? Simples, it only supports Bugzilla at the minute, but there are plans afoot to add others (please see the¬†&lt;a href="http://entomologist.sourceforge.net/#todo" title="what needs to be done"&gt;ToDo&lt;/a&gt;¬†list). Once more bug backends are added it will be great (yes, this is a subtle hint for you to contribute code ;-) ). It is being put forward as one of the¬†&lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011_Ideas#Cross_Platform_Bug_Tracker_Client" title="Part of openSUSE's submission"&gt;GSOC&lt;/a&gt;¬†projects so fingers crossed ;-) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you need some obligatory screenshots, so feast your eyes :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_ObpIMjebLDY/TXC_A6xeQLI/AAAAAAAAAOY/FDjKJM3lPV8/s912/entomologist-desktop.png" alt="Entomologist on the desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing your bugs on the desktop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_ObpIMjebLDY/TXC_Aq_GPaI/AAAAAAAAAOU/qEmmPWywluo/s640/entomologist-android1.png" alt="Seeing your bugs on the move"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing your bugs on the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes that‚Äôs right, entomologist works on Android!! Sure the UI is a bit butt ugly on the platform, but the app works ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll do a post on how I ported entomologist to Android shortly, it wasn‚Äôt too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to give it a whirl, then head over to the homepage and choose your flavour of openSUSE, Fedora, Mandriva, Ubuntu or Debian (thanks¬†&lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Build_Service" title="The openSUSE Build Service"&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that correct ‚Äì I am going to try and port LibreOffice to Android! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Simples, there are no ODF compatible products on Android for reading &amp;amp; writing. There is¬†&lt;a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=at.tomtasche.reader" title="OOo Reader for Android"&gt;OpenOffice Document Reader&lt;/a&gt;¬†which as the name suggests is just a reader, and also OOo is so 2009 ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if I was a half decent hacker, this may not have been such a big deal.¬† Problem is I‚Äôm an absolutley crap hacker, with almost no experience or knowledge of Android or LibreOffice development. So why on earth would I try and do such a monumentally painful task? Two reasons ‚Äì 1. I was challenged by an engineer that I respect to do it. 2. I‚Äôve got an itch that needs scratching (actually I‚Äôm riddled with itches, and the Doc confirms it isn‚Äôt a medical condition ;-) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how to go about it? I‚Äôm still working that one out. As it stands openSUSE doesn‚Äôt provide the necessary tools for the job ‚Äì no decent ARM port :( So I‚Äôm going to have a play with Debian ‚Äì after all 6.0 Squeeze is just out the oven so now‚Äôs as good a time as any. If that doesn‚Äôt work out I‚Äôll give Ubuntu a whirl.¬† Never fear oh mighty Geeko lovers ‚Äì these alien installations will be going on my test machine. My primary machine is still running openSUSE, with GNOME3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll try and document my trip through pain and fun, if for nothing else humour for those more seasoned than me at doing cooky stuff like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as a little side note ‚Äì my primary machine, a Dell D820 decided to die just before FOSDEM. This has left me using my Netbook as my main machine. It took me ~15.5hrs to build LibreOffice on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many people will know I‚Äôve spent around 18 months of my spare time packaging and building the Netbook UX for Moblin/MeeGo on openSUSE.¬† Not on my own, but with a community around me. I would just like to say a huge thank you to that community, you‚Äôve been great and spurred me on when I felt like the whole world was conspiring against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound a bit morose? Well in a way it is. Basically by all accounts MeeGo is stopping all work on the Netbook UX. Yup, all our hard work is now almost for nothing :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first piece of evidence is the¬†&lt;a href="http://wiki.meego.com/Release_Engineering/Plans/1.2" title="MeeGo Release Engineering Pans for 1.2"&gt;Release Engineering Plans for 1.2&lt;/a&gt;.¬† If you look at the bottom, you‚Äôll notice that the Netbook doesn‚Äôt get any mention in Features, just bugs. Actually the same is for the 1.1 release.¬† In all honesty, the biggest change between 1.1 and its predecessor is that all refernces to Moblin was replaced with MeeGo. The next piece of info came at the fabulous FOSDEM XI (I‚Äôll do a seperate post on the event later). I spoke to several people directly and indirectly involved with MeeGo, especially the Netbook UX, about the lack of info on the Netbook UX. Each one of them said the same thing ‚Äì MeeGo is putting the Netbook UX into Maintanence Mode, stopping any further development on it, and only providing bug fixes for major issues.¬† I asked if there was going to be any announcement, basically the answer was nothing official. They‚Äôre just going to let it drift away ‚Äì just like netbooks themselves have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are most likely a huge number of reasons, which is fair enough. I was given a couple of reasons ‚Äì 1: Netbooks arent selling anymore, the Netbook ship didn‚Äôt really sail away, but was sunk. 2: MeeGo doesn‚Äôt want to invest anymore time or effort in gtk development, and wants to concentrate on Qt. Now I take this last one with a tiny bit of salt, only because both Intel and Nokia employ (or at least did so) a sizable team of GNOME developers. Saying that though, if they want to keep a roof over their heads they have to do what their employer says, and both originally started working with touch devices. So it does make sense as much as it doesn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I herby give immediate notice that I am now no longer going to be doing any further work on the MeeGo UX for openSUSE or anyone else.¬† I wont delete the repo for 1.0 but will clear out the 1.1 and 1.2 repos that I had ‚Äì might as well give those resources back :-) Now if anyone would like to continue what I and others had started, then let me know and I would be more than happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cant say what the other distros are going to do, I‚Äôve spoken to my counter part in Fedora, and they‚Äôre having a think about it as they were busting their chops to get things in for the F15 release.¬† Either way I wish all involved luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before any of you conspiracy theory junkies get worked up ‚Äì this has nothing to do with the whole MeeGo Trademark issue that Smeegol had with the Linux Foundation.¬† As it happens I was due to have a conversation with the Linux Foundation about the issues between us and them, but have had to re-schedule due to travel constraints from one party or the other.¬† I still intend to speak with the LF about the issues, as they are still present in the other UX‚Äôs that they are developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it‚Äôs time for me to close off and say, so long and thanks for all the fish! I‚Äôll still be around, I‚Äôll probably start getting back into the GNOME swing of things, and help fcrozat with GNOME3 etc.¬† Oh and I‚Äôve got a lunatic idea for a project which I intend to kick off (stay tuned ;-) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.meego.com/MeeGo_Style_Guide#Trademark_Usage" title="MeeGo's Trademark Usage"&gt;MeeGo is a trademark of the Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also said that it was for 11.4/Factory only and that 11.3 was a WIP. ¬†Well the progress is complete (with huge help from¬†&lt;a href="http://blog.crozat.net/" title="fcrozat - a crazy French man"&gt;Frederic Crozat&lt;/a&gt;, and his great¬†&lt;a href="http://blog.crozat.net/2011/01/gnome-3-live-cd-usb-test-image.html" title="GNOME3 Image for openSUSE"&gt;GNOME3&lt;/a&gt;¬†repo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, more people can have some of this cool shiny stuff.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many know, I have a few Android devices, and I know a lot of other openSUSE fans out there also have robot powered devices.¬† I decided the other day to try something during my lunch break ‚Äì create a widget to show how many days left till 11.4‚Ä≤s release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah I know it isn‚Äôt an earth shattering application, but I‚Äôm not a code monkey, so any working code I generate is a serious plus for me ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my lunchtime project was inspired by the efforts of someone at Ubuntu who was doing the same for their Natty release.¬† I used this¬†&lt;a href="http://www.helloandroid.com/tutorials/days-xmas-widget-tutorial" title="How to create an Android countdown widget"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;¬†to help get me going.¬† I now present to you oSRCD ‚Äì the openSUSE Release CountDown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn‚Äôt perfect, but it is a start, so if there is anyone that is a bit more able in the ways of Android programming or artwork then please join in :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can grab the¬†&lt;a href="https://github.com/awafaa/opensusereleasecountdown" title="oSRCD git repo"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;¬†from github or the¬†&lt;a href="https://github.com/downloads/awafaa/opensusereleasecountdown/oSRCD.apk" title="oSRCD binary"&gt;.apk&lt;/a&gt;¬†for manual install.

&lt;p&gt;There is a little gotcha with the packages ‚Äì it is for openSUSE Factory/11.4 only at the moment. I need to work on backporting some of the shiny dependencies to 11.3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../BoardScreenshot.png" alt="The Board running from packages on openSUSE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things aren‚Äôt 100%, as I need to do a tiny bit of cleaning up with the packages, but it works pretty well for a 0.1.0 release ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;¬†‚Äì To all you doomsday FUD mongers about Novell/SUSE/openSUSE STFU &amp;amp; let us show you what we can and will do!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those living under a rock, yes Novell has agreed to be acquired. Welcome to the world of business, and especially in software this sort of thing is very common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for some reason a whole heap of people seem to think that this spells doom for Novell, SUSE and openSUSE. Why?¬† I really can‚Äôt answer that.¬† What I do know is that all their negative speculation is at best counter productive, at worst foolish and damaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any form of speculation there are no facts to back up what they reckon is going to happen ‚Äì hence the speculation.¬† If there is enough negative talk, negative things will happen. Current customers will look at switching from Novell products whether they be SUSE based or not, purely based on all the negativity that is being generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-one is giving Attachemate a chance to prove what they have openly said ‚Äì Novell, SUSE and openSUSE‚Äôs contribution to the wider community will continue and that it is business as usual.¬† If you look at when Oracle bought Sun they said sod all about OpenSolaris and the rest of Sun. This is different.¬† The new overlords are actually communicating ‚Äì maybe not as much as we would like, but hey it‚Äôs a bloody good step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest negative piece comes from the¬†&lt;a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2010/12/08/linux-kernel-solid-but-what-will-become-of-novell-contribution" title="451 Group FUD"&gt;451 Group&lt;/a&gt;. Why the frig would Novell‚Äôs purchase change their kernel contributions?¬† Why the frig would Novell‚Äôs purchase change any of their current contributions to the vast array of projects including GNOME/KDE/Banshee/LibreOffice/Systemd and a whole heap of others?¬† Simple, it doesn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt get me wrong Novell has screwed up big time in the past, but we are working together as a community to learn from these mistakes.¬† All this negative noise is counter productive and just gets in the way.¬† If you want to see Novell, SUSE and openSUSE flourish hows about you roll your sleeves up and get stuck in?¬† If you don‚Äôt want to chip in STFU and wait and see if something does happen.¬† Then you can berate us and tell us how and where we went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been stewing over a response on the MeeGo developers mailing list for some time now.¬† Basically the MeeGo Project and their steward, the Linux Foundation don‚Äôt seem to be wanting to play this whole open source, open community game.¬† I wouldn‚Äôt have any issue with it if it was just Nokia and Intel fumbling with MeeGo, it would be just another lost opportunity that big corporations screwed up on.¬† Problem is the Linux Foundation is involved and are supposedly the ones guiding the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you don‚Äôt know, before I released Smeegol I asked some questions on the MeeGo Dev list with regards to what openSUSE can/can‚Äôt do/use.¬† That kind of went nowhere.¬† Fedora have also tried asking and again got nowhere.¬†¬†&lt;a href="http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-October/479228.html" title="Debian requesting info from MeeGo"&gt;Debian have also asked&lt;/a&gt;, and after seven weeks the&lt;a href="http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-December/480512.html" title="the LF's response to Debian"&gt;Linux Foundation answered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I was insensed by the response. I spoke to my counterparts at Fedora and they too echoed my feelings. To allow those in the openSUSE and wider community who aren‚Äôt subscribed to the MeeGo lists I‚Äôll provide my response.¬† For those in a rush:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- Don‚Äôt think MeeGo, don‚Äôt say MeeGo, don‚Äôt contribute to MeeGo unless it is on our terms, don‚Äôt use MeeGo unless it is on our crippled distro, MeeGo is going it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that want to see me rant some more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Ibrahim,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thu, 2010-12-09 at 13:12 -0600, Ibrahim Haddad wrote:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Hello Didier,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; I am responding to you in relation to your inquiry below. First,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; thanks very much for sending the MeeGo Project these questions. We&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; really do appreciate it. The MeeGo Project members devoted quite a bit&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; of time discussing these questions to make sure the¬† responses are&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; fair and most of all work to the benefit of the MeeGo project, its&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; developers and the users of MeeGo.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven weeks to effectively turn around and say ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äù?¬† I‚Äôm sorry&lt;br&gt;
if I sound bitter or angry; but the truth of the matter is that I‚Äôm&lt;br&gt;
actually fairly disgusted with how the Linux Foundation, Nokia and Intel&lt;br&gt;
have all acted towards the wider Linux community.¬† For all the talk of&lt;br&gt;
openness at the conference in Dublin all I see are closed doors and&lt;br&gt;
barricades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; To start with, the goal is to avoid any confusion around what is and&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; what is not MeeGo.¬† Anything that is or will become associated with&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; the MeeGo trademark has to be in conformance with the compliance&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; program.¬† With that in mind, it becomes clear why none of the proposed&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; uses of MeeGo¬† mentioned in your email are in line with the trademark&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; policy and guidelines as they create confusion around MeeGo project&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; packages, mailing list, project team name, etc.¬† For example, when you&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; append MeeGo to a package name, it would be very reasonable to&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; conclude that this is an official MeeGo package coming from MeeGo.com,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; which is not the case and could cause confusion both for your users as&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; well MeeGo‚Äôs.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sorry but do you honestly think that users who install the MeeGo UX&lt;br&gt;
on a distro be it openSUSE, Fedora, Debian or whichever are going to&lt;br&gt;
think that it has come from the MeeGo project?¬† This doesn‚Äôt happen for&lt;br&gt;
any open source project that is available via a distribution. GNOME, KDE&lt;br&gt;
etc welcome inclusion into distros and want downstream involvement.¬† Why&lt;br&gt;
do you feel that MeeGo doesn‚Äôt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to paint all users with a stupid brush is wrong and condescending&lt;br&gt;
to both users and distros.¬† You appear to be missing a key factor that&lt;br&gt;
myself and my counterparts are doing here ‚Äì marketing MeeGo and enabling&lt;br&gt;
the wider community to get involved and help make MeeGo better.¬† Why&lt;br&gt;
should a developer have to install a new distro to be able to contribute&lt;br&gt;
to the codebase?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having meego in a package name shows where the upstream contribution&lt;br&gt;
comes from.¬† Just like with packages from Google etc.¬† This is the most&lt;br&gt;
basic form of attribution, and is only right.¬† Why are you trying to&lt;br&gt;
force people to fork?¬† Yes, fork.¬† If you don‚Äôt want people to recognise&lt;br&gt;
your work and re-use it with almost no changes why have it in the open?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux users and especially developers can be fickle, they find a distro&lt;br&gt;
they like and stick to it ‚Äì quite often they are more faithful to their&lt;br&gt;
distro than they are to their partner or loved one.¬† Forcing them to&lt;br&gt;
choose between distro or contributing to MeeGo the chances are they‚Äôll&lt;br&gt;
stick to their distro of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Moblin was around, it was one of three things ‚Äì a User eXperience,&lt;br&gt;
a distribution and a reference platform.¬† This worked well, so why have&lt;br&gt;
you changed it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; We would ask you to move away from using {M,m}-e-e-{G,g}-o or any&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; subset of those letters or sounds in that order, alone or in&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; combination with other letters, words or marks that would tend to&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; cause someone to make a reasonable connection of the reference with&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; the MeeGo mark. We specifically discussed one possibility for&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; illustration purposes ‚Äì which is to use MG in the place of MeeGo.¬† We&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; do not think that a plain text MG, when used in reference to the code,&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; as in a file or project or team name, would cause a reasonable person&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; to be confused.&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fanatical enforcement of the MeeGo trademark is going to do more&lt;br&gt;
damage than good.¬† People have asked me what‚Äôs different between MeeGo‚Äôs&lt;br&gt;
trademark guidelines and openSUSE‚Äôs, and the simple answer is it is the&lt;br&gt;
execution of the trademark that sets us apart.¬† Thinking that people are&lt;br&gt;
going to get ‚Äúconfused‚Äù between Smeegol and MeeGo is ludicrous.¬† Sure&lt;br&gt;
I‚Äôm not a lawyer/solicitor or any other form of legal professional, but&lt;br&gt;
I don‚Äôt need to be to apply common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are trying to promote MeeGo and further it in an already crowded&lt;br&gt;
space.¬† Making us change package names, and removing any reference to&lt;br&gt;
MeeGo gives you absolutely zero visibility.¬† At the end of the day,&lt;br&gt;
openSUSE and the other distros have a much wider reach than MeeGo does,&lt;br&gt;
and possibly ever will as a stand alone distro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; We are available for additional discussions if needed and if you&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; prefer to have a call to discuss we can certainly do that.&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried several times to discuss these issues, and have even tried&lt;br&gt;
going off list to facilitate the dialogue in a more protected manner.&lt;br&gt;
MeeGo is far from open to the community, if I was an ISV or ISV then&lt;br&gt;
sure it maybe more open but from what I‚Äôve heard even partners have a&lt;br&gt;
tough time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an exclusive project is a sure way to failure. Try being&lt;br&gt;
inclusive, you‚Äôll have more chance of succeeding.¬† If you don‚Äôt want&lt;br&gt;
community participation that‚Äôs fine, re-license to something proprietary&lt;br&gt;
and you wont get bothered by those that want to help.¬† Yes you have&lt;br&gt;
already re-licensed some code from open licenses to proprietary ones&lt;br&gt;
without any announcement to the community, not a great open gesture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; Ibrahim Haddad [on behalf of The Meego Project]&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; PS:&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; We started an FAQ at http://meego.com/trademark. We have added some&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt; text already and Q&amp;amp;A will be added there as they come.&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt see a single question or answer in that FAQ, just a statement.&lt;br&gt;
Not especially helpful to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2010-12-08T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2010-12-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/12/08/smeegol-status-08dec10.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Looks like it‚Äôs been a while since I mentioned anything about our dear friend Smeegol ‚Äì sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most will know MeeGo made a couple of releases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  1.0.5 mostly an update to their original release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  1.1.0 the new release with new API, and renaming most packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where is Smeegol? ¬†Well we‚Äôre pretty much there, although not 100%. ¬†I have 1.0.5 all built and packaged including an image. ¬†Problem is I seem to have hit a bug with network-manager-netbook ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt seem to be displaying networks which is a fairly fundamental issue :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also got 1.1.0 built, but for factory only atm ‚Äì I‚Äôm having some issues with tracker on 11.3. ¬†Problem is when I try and run the image, I basically have an unusable system thanks to some Gconf fubar but I don‚Äôt really know what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have also noticed that I‚Äôm still calling it Smeegol ;-) Well the simple reason is I have requested clarification from MeeGo, Nokia, Intel and the Linux Foundation and so far I‚Äôve received bubkiss!! ¬†I heard loads of talk from the recent MeeGo Conference about how open MeeGo was, but it seems that they are only open to partners who can help them make money; not open to the wider community. ¬†I am not alone in waiting for a response from them, Fedora and Debian are also in limbo waiting for information/clarification and general communication from them. ¬†The difference between us is the fact that in openSUSE if you want something done the best way is to Just Do It :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a nutshell, before I make an official release of either I need people to test and report back to me what does and doesn‚Äôt work. ¬†I haven‚Äôt tried doing an upgrade from 1.0.3 to 1.0.5 or 1.1.0 so maybe someone could try that. ¬†Jump onto #opensuse-moblin on Freenode or the opensuse-goblin mailing list and let‚Äôs continue to be trail blazers. Yes I know I need to align the mailing list and irc channel names, but I‚Äôm waiting for a conclusion to the name debacle first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would really love to get both releases out as a little christmas present to you the community, so who‚Äôs up for some festive fun?&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/11/17/a-galaxy-in-my-pocket.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yet again I get a dose of the Early Adopter jitters ‚Äì I tried to hold out but I just couldn‚Äôt. I went and got me some shiny robot lovin‚Äô from Korea, and boy do I love this particular droid ‚Äì the fabulous (IMHO) Samsung GT-P1000 better known as the Galaxy Tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my third dedicated Android device, the first being the Motorola Milestone 11months ago, followed by the Nexus One around Easter time this year. I kind of understand why some people end up with so many Apple devices now :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got a lot I want to say about the device, so I‚Äôll be breaking it down into multiple posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why the heck did I go for it? Well I had specific requirements from a tablet styled device:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It needs to be easily portable. Yes my netbook is portable in comparison to my laptop, but I need some form of bag even for it. Also it weighs a bit too, and isn‚Äôt easy to use one handed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It needs to have good media support. Yeah, I‚Äôm talking about that thing we all love to hate ‚Äì codec proliferation!! Also screen quality helps here too as does audio quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Good network support. Basically I don‚Äôt want to have to worry about buggering around setting up bluetooth pairings, hooking up cables etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Good applicatipon ecosystem. I want to be able to get applications that I want and need easily and conveniently without being tied to a big old school machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Video calling support. This isn‚Äôt vital, but it is pretty damned close to it. Both my wife‚Äôs and my family is pretty much disperesed across three out of four corners of the globe, and being able to do some form of video calling not only makes staying in touch cheaper, but we also get to see each other‚Äôs ugly mugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Some light relief. This can be in the form of games or other methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they‚Äôre fairly reasonable requirements.¬† So how does the Tab meet my six simple requirements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The device is about the same size (height &amp;amp; width) as one of those weird paper book things (/me was horrified how long ago I last read a physical book :-/), and about as thick as a cheque book. I sits very comfortably in one hand, and I can easily grip hold of it wrapping my fingers around both sides. It is also fairly light, it only starts to get heavy after about 45-60mins or so of single handed holding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It shines beautifully with media playback. It has native support for Divx which means anything my PS3 can play so can my Tab (almost all my DVDs are ripped so that I can easily watch them on any device). The 7 inch screen is great for watching films or web based video. Very clear and crisp and just generally great. Samsung‚Äôs video player is also great. I‚Äôm not sure if it is the same as on the Galaxy S as I haven‚Äôt really seen or used one of them, but the controls are very good and not intrusive. The music player is by far one of the best I‚Äôve used on Android. The little touch of being able to access it using a drop down mini version whilst the screen is locked is great. My only grumble here is that I can‚Äôt get it to scrobble to Last.fm, not a huge issue, but still‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Well believe it or not this tablet can also be a phone. It has full telephony functionality, the same as my Milestone or Nexus One. So that means I can get onto the net pretty much anywhere. Yes it also has wireless support as one would hope. So now I can always get online when I need to. Also as it is running 2.2 Froyo, I have the mobile hotspot functionality (I hate the sound of MiFi) so any of my devices can connect through it sans cables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I know some people are going to rip the Android Marketplace a new arsehole, but seriously, have you tried Ovi from Nokia? Personally I have not had any issues using the Marketplace, apps are grouped fairly sensibly, details on the apps are fairly correct, it‚Äôs easy to go to the apps‚Äô homepage and contact the developer. Oh and it has almost all the apps I want/need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It has a 1.3MP front facing camera which you can use for either still photos ‚Äì self portrait style ‚Äì or video calling. The only issue here is getting cross platform applications. Yes Skype is available but it doesn‚Äôt support video calls from Android (yet?). I‚Äôm not aware of being able to use the Gmail video chat thingy yet (also don‚Äôt really know anyone using it). The only one that I‚Äôm aware of atm is Yahoo! which is a shame as most people I know have moved off of Yahoo and onto other services. But the main thing is the hardware is in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Well there are plenty of games available for android devices, some not so good, but some are very good, and they look great on the large sharp screen. Samsung have partnered with Gameloft to provide some ‚ÄòHD‚Äô games, and on the whole these games are pretty good ‚Äì NOVA is preinstalled, a FPS Doom style game which I like; I bought Let‚Äôs Golf for some sporting sillyness, Dragon Hunter for some D&amp;amp;Desque fantasy RPG, and Asphalt5 for some accelerometer fun. They all look and play pretty sweetly on the Tab. There are more titles available and all titles are available for trial. Samsung also bundle in an ebook reader that accepts any epub publications you may have. It looks and behave just like the paper based ones, even with the sound &amp;amp; visual effects of turning pages. They also have their ‚ÄúReaderHub‚Äù app, this holds three apps inside ‚Äì a Newspaper app powered by PressDisplay, an Book app powered by Kobo, and a Magazine app powered by Zinio. All three of these work brilliantly and have a *huge* amount of content available. I‚Äôll stop there for now, and try and get the next post up soon. In a nutshell if you‚Äôre wondering whether to get one or not and you ask me what do I think, my answer is YES get one. I‚Äôve had mine now for almost two weeks and I don‚Äôt regret it at all. My wife actually likes it, and my children have added ‚ÄúTab‚Äù into their vocabulary (and no I don‚Äôt meant the cigarette end, or the march with backpacks and full battle gear).¬† Oh and Angry Birds is stunning on the bigger screen :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that‚Äôs it for now, I‚Äôll come back with some more soon. If there‚Äôs anything in particular people would like to know, just shout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(P.S. this post was written entirely on my Tab ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I unfortunately received an¬†&lt;a href="http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-October/006547.html" title="Not happy about the trademark &amp;amp; name"&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt;¬†just now from the Linux Foundation with regards to our precious Smeegol, and it appears on the face of it that they‚Äôre not that impressed with our efforts.¬† Somewhat bizarrely as they have had plenty of¬†&lt;a href="http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-September/006004.html" title="Asking about the trademark etc"&gt;opportunity&lt;/a&gt;¬†to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I‚Äôm not going to start ranting and raving about injustice etc, what I will say is this and it is a bit of a rant ;-) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Moblin morphed into MeeGo, things appear from the outside to have taken a bit of a dip for the worse :-( ¬† MeeGo is now pushing the fact that it is a distro in it‚Äôs own right which is perfectly acceptable and fair (although I think the world has enough distros).¬† There are several people within the paid community who look on our efforts and those of Fedora‚Äôs as wasteful, and not for the greater good.¬† Sorry but bollocks to you!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wholly understand now why Canonical &amp;amp; Ubuntu dropped it and went down their own road with UNR &amp;amp; Unity.¬† They don‚Äôt mind if someone else packages it and uses it ‚Äì they and everyone else knows where it came from ‚Äì for that I doff my cap to the Ubuntu crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Linux Foundation really want to make MeeGo work and be prevalent everywhere they need to look to the wider community to help it.¬† Having a niche distro is all good and well, but without the wider eco-system that goes along with a distro you‚Äôre buggered.¬† One of the reasons I started working on Smeegol is openSUSE has a fantastic ecosystem, we‚Äôve got pretty good tools and have a shit load of applications available.¬† The same goes for Fedora.¬† We both also have a pretty vibrant community with lots of friendly and knowledgable people willing to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I unfortunately can‚Äôt say the same for MeeGo.¬† They have taken the Build Service but closed the door on it, so application contributions can‚Äôt happen easily. They seem to want to build a community from OEMs and partners, effectively become an exclusive community and not inclusive.¬† Harsh?¬† Maybe but that‚Äôs what it seems like, and I‚Äôm not the only one to see it this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest disappointment for me is the fact that MeeGo is supposedly under the Linux Foundation‚Äôs banner.¬† These peeps are supposed to be championing the greater Linux cause, but can‚Äôt see the cluster that is happening under their noses.¬† They are complaining that legally I can‚Äôt call the project Smeegol or use any variation of MeeGo, and not use any of their logos/charchters/artwork/etc as it will dilute and weaken their trademark ‚Äì WTF?!?¬† Hellfire, after we announced the release of Smeegol the first thing that people thought of when they heard it was Lord Of The Rings,¬†&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;MeeGo or the Linux Foundation.¬† If you ask me (which I know no one is, but I‚Äôll answer anyway), actively pushing distros to include MeeGo will only strengthen the brand and mark, not weaken it.¬† I asked the question on the MeeGo development mailing list, and had absolutely no response from the trademark holders (that would be the Linux Foundation), only after a kind teddy bear of a kernel hacker (that would be Greg Kroah-Hartman) jumped in and started knocking heads did someone pipe up ‚Äì Thanks Greg :-)¬† Even then it was a wishy washy response with no substance and not an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have my answer, and now I‚Äôm not so sure what next.¬† Yes I‚Äôm pissed off, and I think I have a right to be.¬† The crucial thing is I want to resolve this so that we can all get on and enjoy the shiny that is being produced.¬† I‚Äôve spent the better part of eight months working on getting Moblin and subsequently MeeGo built and running on openSUSE, the latter was very tough.¬† I am still working on it, trying to get 1.1 build and ready, updating the network front-end as well as lots of other bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, any suggestions on what to do next? :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So after many months of hard work,¬†&lt;a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/06/announcing-smeegol-1-0/" title="Announcing Smeegol 1.0"&gt;Smeegol is out the door&lt;/a&gt;. ¬†Now contrary to what some folk may think, this was *NOT* a one man show ‚Äì far from it! ¬†I may have spearheaded the whole affair, but I in no way can take credit for it all ‚Äì that doesn‚Äôt mean I wouldn‚Äôt accept any of your fine donations ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd like to take this opportunity to thank many of the people that helped get this labour of love out the door. ¬†Without them I most likely would still be floundering around, working out my backside from my elbow. This truely shows how great not just the openSUSE community is but also the wider open source &amp;amp; Linux community is in general. ¬†So with out further delay, I‚Äôd like to thank the following people (in alphabetical order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross Burton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent Untz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is by no means exhaustive, I would also like to thank the following projects in general:&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought I should let anyone that cares know what the latest status of my work is.¬† What work?¬† Getting MeeGo on openSUSE, of course!¬† I‚Äôm calling it Smeegol ‚Äì SUSE MeeGo Linux, and this just happens to be the Teal Goblin ‚Äì Teal is the code name for 11.3 ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I‚Äôm not quite there yet (unfortunately) :-(¬† I have one major issue which is the Network Panel not displaying properly, and as such is difficult to use.¬† I also have a smaller issue with the web panel, but that is more of an annoyance rather than a blocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a nutshell that‚Äôs the state of play.¬† Now I‚Äôm concentrating on getting things working on 11.3 and getting a working image, but if people would like to see things get into openSUSE 11.4 then there are some low hanging fruit for people to pick up and run with.¬† In a nutshell before things can make it into Factory, the spec files need to be cleaned up and made to comply with the Geeko‚Äôs high standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please join in the fun and have a look at the¬†&lt;a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=Meego:Netbook" title="MeeGo Netbook on the oBS"&gt;Meego:Netbook&lt;/a&gt;¬†repo, and help out where you can.¬† I wanted to get things working first before I started to look at housekeeping.¬† Some packages already comply, but others most certainly don‚Äôt as they were straight imports from upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you want to try Smeegol as it stands now, warts and all, you can grab the live image from¬†&lt;a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Meego:/Netbook/images/iso/" title="Smeegol Live image"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you‚Äôre brave (or stupid) you can get the goodness via 1Click for¬†&lt;a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Meego:/Netbook/openSUSE_11.3/GoblinUI.ymp" title="Smeegol 1Click for 11.3"&gt;11.3&lt;/a&gt;¬†or¬†&lt;a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Meego:/Netbook/openSUSE_Factory/GoblinUI.ymp" title="Smeegol 1Click for Factory"&gt;Factory&lt;/a&gt;. Yes it is 32bit only at the moment, as when packaging I had too many x86_64 errors.¬† Please note that the Goblin may chew fluffy bunnies, sodomise gorrilas and generally be an imp!¬† You can file bugs if you wish over on¬†[BNC][7]¬†just select the Moblin Component&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[7]: https://bugzilla.novell.com/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided&amp;amp;classification=28&amp;amp;product=openSUSE 11.3&amp;amp;submit=Use This Product "Bugzilla at Novell"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please join in the fun and help clean up the Goblin :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought it was about time that I enlightened people as to what the¬†state of play is with my efforts of getting MeeGo 1.0 for Netbooks on¬†openSUSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is I think I‚Äôm pretty much there :-)¬† I believe all the¬†essential packages are built now, although there is a¬†&lt;strong&gt;*lot\&lt;/strong&gt;*¬†of work to¬†be done in getting the packages into Factory.¬† The outstanding work is¬†mostly spec file housekeeping but non the less it will be a relatively¬†laborious task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently looking at getting a hybrid iso image built so that¬†people can install the goodness straight of the bat and have the image¬†available pretty close to 11.3‚Ä≤s release ‚Äì this may or may not happen as¬†fast as I would like but we‚Äôll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that are interested all the packages etc live in¬†&lt;a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=Meego:Netbook" title="MeeGo Netbook on the oBS"&gt;Meego:Netbook&lt;/a&gt;, and the image stuff lives in the meego-live package in¬†there.¬† Any and all help with cleaning spec files and creating an image¬†is most appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking of thanks, none of this would have happened without the huge¬†amounts of help from DimStar, darix, dl9pf, joeyli, glin, mchang, mlin, mmeeks¬†and vuntz. Thank you¬†&lt;strong&gt;*SO\&lt;/strong&gt;*¬†much chaps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try and get a 1-Click done whilst I work on an image.¬† If people could have a look at the repo and let me know if anything is missing that would be great ‚Äì don‚Äôt forget you can submit anything that is missing ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I have anything new I‚Äôll let you know.¬†¬† So if you want to join in the fun, then head over to #opensuse-moblin on IRC and the opensuse-goblin mailing list.¬† There are lots for people to do, and if you want to start contributing this is a good way to do so ![:-)][1]&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It looks like I‚Äôve been asking you, the community, a load of questions recently on this here blog.¬† As such I thought it only fair to turn the tables and let you guys and girls do the asking :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can make a bit of a game out of this I would appreciate it.¬† So first up I‚Äôll give you a deadline of 1200UTC 17June2010 to get you questions in by.¬† What‚Äôs the game?¬† Simple, I would like you lot to pretend you are interviewing our prospective Community Manager.¬† Does this sound a bit bitchy to you because I‚Äôm no longer in the running?¬† If so I genuinely don‚Äôt mean it to be.¬† I just want you to actually search within yourselves, to work out what you feel is important to you when it comes to the role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all good games have a prize right? Well this shall be no different, the top 5 questions will each receive a prize.¬† So get to it and post your questions in the comments.¬† When thinking about what to ask, think about what you would like from the role, and why.¬† Also many big employers ask what appear to be oddball questions, but they are in fact very relevant ‚Äì these types could earn brownie points ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So get questioning!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a while since I mentioned anything about Goblin and anything netbook related, sorry. ¬†Anyhow as everyone is aware, Moblin has since been superseded by MeeGo. ¬†The timing was a bit of a PITA for me, as it coincided with the Factory freeze, which means I couldn‚Äôt update the relevant packages etc in-time for 11.3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands, 11.3 should have an almost fully functional Moblin environment ‚Äì I say ‚Äòalmost‚Äô as there were two packages that I just couldn‚Äôt get to co-operate and build (the modified Moblin browser, and the Web panel). ¬†They should not affect your enjoyment of the UX so I‚Äôm not going to kick myself too hard. ¬† I have learnt several lessons though trying to get Moblin into Factory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:¬†Getting things into the next distro release is¬†&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;¬†difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, the process is very simple and straight forward. ¬†Importantly, there is a huge amount of help from all parties that deal with the acceptance etc. ¬†If you need help or guidance, just ask! I can‚Äôt stress enough how much help is available to people. ¬†I would personally like to thank everyone that helped, but I know I will miss some people off due to my feeble brain. ¬†As a start these people have been invaluable to the process ‚Äì Andreas Jaeger, Marcus Ruckert, Stephan Kulow, Michael Meeks, Henne Vogelsang, Pascal Blesser, Andrea Florio &amp;amp; Dominique Luerenberger. ¬†Thank you all (and sorry to those whom I missed of listing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2:¬†You need to plan, and plan well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off with great intentions, but I didn‚Äôt take into account how disruptive my daytime job would be. ¬†Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt wopn the lottery and as such I have to deal with ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù, otherwise I have no food or house :-(¬†Part of my bad planning led to me missing the cut-off for getting Moblin listed as an installable option from the get go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:¬†Spread the love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a saying I‚Äôve heard many times and from many different places ‚Äì A burden shared is a burden eased. ¬†Do you know what? ¬†It‚Äôs absolutely true! ¬†Even if there are only a couple of you dealing with a project, it makes things so much easier, and having more is just plain fun :-) ¬†I tried to get some of you reprobates to join in, but you were all too busy. ¬†As such the pace of progress was fairly slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4.¬†Have fun doing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies to almost anything you do, but especially when doing any form of contribution. If you feel that it is getting you down, take a break, try and pass the baton to someone else to carry it forward for a bit. ¬†What ever you do, don‚Äôt let it burn you out! ¬†Loosing a contributor to burn-out is disastrous for the community, and is something we should all be aware of and on the look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that‚Äôs the past/present, what about the present/future? ¬†Well Goblin will live on, and incorporate all the new goodness that is coming out of MeeGo. ¬†I do genuinely think that MeeGo is a vast improvement on Moblin, but as always there‚Äôs room for improvement; and what better way to start improving than by getting the Geeko involved? :-)¬†As my contribution to HackWeek 5, I have started the importing process for all the MeeGo packages, into the OBS. ¬†Believe it or not, there are only a handful of packages that can be carried over from Moblin which is a bugger. ¬†Regardless I think I have got pretty much all the needed pieces in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is the way I‚Äôve done it is pretty hacky ‚Äì I basically just ¬†dropped the contents of the SRPMs in and hoped for the best. ¬†This was done mainly for speed, and I know that it isn‚Äôt good enough. ¬†Problem is I‚Äôm trying to balance my regular job and dealing with managing the renovation of my parent‚Äôs house at the same time, so I really don‚Äôt have a huge amount of spare time :-/ ¬†So this is where¬†&lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;/strong&gt;¬†come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help me to not only get Goblin updated to the latest and greatest that MeeGo has to offer, but also prove to everyone outside of the openSUSE community that we are a coherent and cohesive force to be reckoned with! ¬†Too many people discount us, and just say that without Novell nothing would get done. ¬†Please help me to help you to prove this assumption to be a load of rubbish. ¬†We have the tools and knowledge available to us, so let‚Äôs get on with it and get it done! ¬†Oh and we have the real opportunity to be a leader here ‚Äì the first distro to provide a full MeeGo experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you can help, then please join in on¬†&lt;a href="irc://irc.freenode.com/opensuse-moblin" title="openSUSE Moblin/MeeGo IRC channel"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;¬†(#opensuse-moblin), and on the¬†&lt;a href="mailto:opensuse-goblin@opensuse.org" title="The Goblin mailing list"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;¬†( make sure you are¬†&lt;a href="mailto:opensuse-goblin+subscribe@opensuse.org" title="Subscribe to the Goblin Mailing List"&gt;subscribed&lt;/a&gt;¬†first). ¬†The first step is to get everything building, from there we can move forward. ¬†Oh by the way, this initial push is for the Netbook UX, but I‚Äôd love to see use get the Handheld/Tablet UX when that is released ![;-)][6] ¬†I‚Äôm tempted by Garrett‚Äôs name suggestion of Smeegol, but let‚Äôs get it building and working first ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve had a lot of people ask me both within the openSUSE community and outside of it, whether I applied for the vacant openSUSE Community Manager role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, yes I did apply for it.¬† Why the past tense?¬† Well I got notified almost two weeks ago that I was unsuccessful :‚Äô-(¬† The good thing that did come out of it, is that there seem to be some very good candidates in the running ‚Äì let‚Äôs face it, they would have to be pretty damned good to beat me ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Novell for considering me for the role, and wish those that are in the running the best of luck!¬† Oh I‚Äôd also like to ask you, the community, to extend your support to whomever is successful in getting the role.¬† This doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm giving up on the Geeko ‚Äì hell I‚Äôve invested too much time &amp;amp; effort to throw it away, and I have far too many friends within the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the successful person: Please ensure you look after all aspects of the community, your colleagues working for ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù as well as those of us who do it for the love.¬† Let‚Äôs not loose what we have by chasing that which we haven‚Äôt :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Enterprise in the Community&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been mentioned that the Geeko is somewhat of a schizophrenic at times, and do you know what I kind of have to agree.¬† The difference is I disagree on how the schizophrenia affects our dear friend.¬† Most people think that the multiple personalities are desktop related¬† ‚Äì you know, KDE vs GNOME vs XFCE vs $DE.¬† I on the other hand feel it is to with audience ‚Äì Enterprise vs Consumer.¬† Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, the Geeko does a great job at both.¬† The problem is there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a great deal of interaction between the two personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, some features from the enterprise product feed into the consumer product and vice versa which is lovely and vital.¬† What is missing is community interaction.¬† As it stands I see very little evidence of SLE customers interacting with the openSUSE community, and to an extent SLE is somewhat shunned as the illegitimate love child by many within the openSUSE community ‚Äì which is just plain wrong!¬† There are times when SLE deadlines get on my nerves, but that is no reason to shun the staff working on it or disrespect the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my job working for a major systems provider and integrator in the UK, we use a lot of SLE and others including Red Hat, AIX, Solaris and HP-UX.¬† The one thing that is constant is we don‚Äôt interact with the communities of the OSes, unless it is via the Sales/Support departments.¬† Now it might be because of time constraints, but I‚Äôm not convinced.¬† I haven‚Äôt seen any ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù interact with the openSUSE community other than maybe with the Build Service.¬† Which is a real shame, as there are some great customers of the SLE product and some great people employed by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do our peers deal with it? To be honest I have no idea :-) I can only guess that they encounter the same issue, well potentially Red Hat &amp;amp; Fedora.¬† Ubuntu on the other hand have somewhat of an advantage, in so much as their enterprise product isn‚Äôt a separate product but in fact part of the standard release.¬† So when it comes to getting ISVs, partners and customers involved they can safely say that *all* Ubuntu users can benefit from it ‚Äì not just the enterprise customers.¬† This is a crucial point, as more people are likely to use the distro and play with it and then sign the big fat cheque for the support.¬† By that time they have already got involved with the community and will most likely continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not trying to tell Novell that they need to change their business model, all what I‚Äôm saying is we need Novell‚Äôs help to engage their customers and partners to be part of OUR community ‚Äì N.B Our Community == openSUSE *&amp;amp;* SLE.¬† At the end of the day it‚Äôs a win/win situation for all parties ‚Äì they can then get maximum exposure, an element of testing of their product without having to start from scratch to get things certified etc. We benefit from a bigger community thanks to their involvement, and have many more cool things to use/play with ![:-)][1] ¬†¬† A key one here is that of ISVs, there are a shed load of ISVs that are certified against SLE ‚Äì iirc somewhere in the region of 5000 apps.¬† That‚Äôs an impressive number, but unfortunately openSUSE sees bupkiss! Absolutely nada, niet, nil points, zilch :-(  Looking at Ubuntu they apparently have a fraction of that amount ‚Äì somehere in the region of 200 or so.¬† The big difference is that almost *all* Ubunteros can use or access those apps.¬† The same goes for IHVs ‚Äì hardware is only certified against SLE products which is great, but openSUSE doesn‚Äôt get a look in.¬† There are some vendors that sell their kit with openSUSE pre-installed but there isn‚Äôt the same sort of love coming from the mothership for them which really could do with changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like I digressed somewhat ‚Äì sorry.¬† So getting back on track(ish) how many of you guys and gals use SLE professionally?¬† It could be either SLES or SLED.¬† If you do use a SLE product do you partake in the openSUSE community professionally or is it purely part of your undying love for the Geeko? If you don‚Äôt is there a particular reason why not, anything blocking you joining in, or do you just choose not to?¬† If you do participate as part of your job, what issues do you encounter, what could be improved etc?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always I would love to hear from you if you have anything to discuss on the topic of Enterprise in the Community. Remember this is for your benefit as part of the openSUSE community. So please join in and get discussing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/05/10/community-discussion-part-7.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes I‚Äôm still at it, trying to get YOU the openSUSE community talking about what is important to you.¬† This time round I‚Äôd like to hear your opinions and thoughts about something.¬† I‚Äôm going to keep my views on the matter quiet until we get some dialogue going, so if you want to hear my thoughts (and let‚Äôs face it who doesn‚Äôt? ;-) ) best you start airing your opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the topic? That of Community Manager.¬† As many are aware, Novell have started interviewing for a replacement.¬† Some were not happy with how the role was done in the past and some and some were, but the key part of that statement is PAST!¬† Let‚Äôs move on and look to the future, and as part of that looking forward to the future I would like to hear what YOU would like from the new Community Manager?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs take a moment to see what the official blurb for the¬†&lt;a href="http://careers.novell.com/psp/css89prd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM.HRS_CE.GBL" title="Official openSUSE Community Manager Vacancy at Novell"&gt;job vacancy&lt;/a&gt;¬†said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äú&lt;em&gt;As openSUSE Community Manager, you will work to promote the openSUSE Project, openSUSE Build Service, and sub-projects such as the education project. Your key objectives will be to grow the number of openSUSE users and contributors, and further enhance Novell‚Äôs relationship with the openSUSE community and larger community of open source influencers and project maintainers. You will work closely with the openSUSE community, Novell leadership, and broader open source community. This is a unique opportunity to take a high-profile role in the open source world and make a truly global impact.&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The listed key responsibilities are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Develop and execute a marketing plan to promote and evangelize openSUSE, in order to achieve the key objectives above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Plan and execute launch plans for openSUSE product releases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Serve as a frequent public face of the openSUSE Project to the community by blogging; seeking and providing press interviews; speaking at conferences and other events; and actively participating in social media. You will deliver fresh perspectives and thought leadership in these activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Work directly with &amp;amp; facilitate activities for the openSUSE Ambassadors &amp;amp; Marketing Team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Engage with, support and encourage openSUSE community members via online venues such as IRC, forums, mailing lists and others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Help to organize major events, including the openSUSE Conference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Work closely with key stakeholders from openSUSE and Novell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do you (dis)agree with what‚Äôs there?¬† What else would you add?¬† Also if you feel there is a particular issue that the new Community manager needs to address what is that issue, why should they be involved and how do you think they could resolve it?¬† How would you advertise the position?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are bound to have opposing issue on items, and that is fine ‚Äì if anything it is healthy and should be promoted.¬† As always this is about having a discussion, not a flame war.¬† Please try and be curteous to your fellow community members and if you can‚Äôt say anything constructive ‚Äì don‚Äôt say anthing at all :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So people, let‚Äôs have your valuable opinions and thoughts on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/05/07/opensuse-and-the-ways-of-a11y.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So further to my post on¬†&lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/05/06/getting-opensuse-from-a-to-y.html" title="Getting openSUSE from A to Y"&gt;a11y in openSUSE&lt;/a&gt;, I was asked how one would enable Accessibility.¬† Now to be honest I only¬†&lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt;¬†know how to do it in GNOME, so I set off on a little exploration of the other desktop environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem strange that I‚Äôm trying to champion a subject that I don‚Äôt really know, but that‚Äôs part of the reason¬†&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;¬†I‚Äôm doing so.¬† Accessibility isn‚Äôt supposed to a buzzword, it is meant to be a usable function for all.¬† Hopefully I can learn a bit along the way and get the message out there ‚Äì oh and if you could do the same that would just be spiffy ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I present what I have found so far below in a simple little pictorial guide of how to get to the general a11y settings.¬† I have tried four desktops ‚Äì GNOME, KDE, XFCE and LXDE, I couldn‚Äôt find anything in LXDE so I‚Äôll try and revisit it later once I‚Äôve had more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For¬†&lt;strong&gt;GNOME:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the main menu select ‚ÄúControl Center‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-1.png" alt="Step 1 to enable a11y on GNOME"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then under the ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù section, select ‚ÄúAssistive Technologies‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-2.5.png" alt="Step 2 to enable a11y on GNOME"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select ‚ÄúEnable assitive technologies‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-3.png" alt="Step 3 to enable a11y on GNOME"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you enable assitive technologies you need to restart your session for the changes to take effect.¬† You can easily do this by selecting the ‚ÄúClose and Log Out‚Äù button at the bottom of the window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableGNOMEa11y-4.png" alt="Step 4 to enable a11y on GNOME"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For¬†&lt;strong&gt;KDE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Kicker menu select ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù then ‚ÄúSystem Settings‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableKDEa11y-1.png" alt="Step 1 to enable a11y on KDE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù section select ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableKDEa11y-2.5.png" alt="Step 2 to enable a11y on KDE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For¬†&lt;strong&gt;XFCE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the menu select ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù then ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/a11y/EnableXFCEa11y-1.5.png" alt="Step 1 to enable a11y on XFCE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said this is just a very quick guide on how to do it.¬† I‚Äôm very sure there are more settings to deal with, especially in KDE but I don‚Äôt know them (yet).¬† If you do then please shout out and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the next things I need to learn is what applications are there specifically for a11y.¬† I know of a few but never used them (at least I dont think I have), and I‚Äôm sure I only know of a small number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the subject of a11y is possibly a very misunderstood one, I for one incorrectly associated it with disabled use of a computer.¬† I have been corrected (on more than one occasion) to the fact that Accessibility actually refers to the ability for anybody to be able to use a computer (or any other device) regardless of any impairment they might have.¬† So that means both people with¬†&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;¬†without disabilities are a11y users.¬† In addition to that, a11y can also help developers to automate testing ‚Äì quite often UI testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extreme case of a11y usage could be a blind person who can‚Äôt see a GUI the way someone with 20/20 vision can, or someone with spectacles.¬† They may have to use a tool called a screen reader (&lt;a href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca" title="Orca Screen Reader"&gt;Orca&lt;/a&gt;¬†is common on Linux) that describes what‚Äôs on the screen by speaking through the speakers.¬† So in order to get something like Orca to work, application UIs need to be understandable by Orca in a programmatic way and that pays off with the automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs the issue?¬† Well from what I can see, and what I have heard, is that openSUSE sucks the goat‚Äôs back-end when it come‚Äôs to a11y.¬† In all honesty I don‚Äôt have any real evidence to back this claim, but one thing I do know is that we don‚Äôt really do much as a community about it.¬† Before anyone flips this to a ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt Novell paying for people to work on it full time‚Äù argument, shush!¬† This is a misconception that I think people have about corporate sponsors to a project; as it happens Novell does employ some folks to work on a11y indirectly thanks to the working partnership with Microsoft, check out the great work by the¬†&lt;a href="http://www.mono-project.com/A11y" title="Accessibilty by Mono"&gt;Mono a11y team&lt;/a&gt;.¬† If we as a community want to get some dedicated resources assigned to anything, we need to make the case first, we have to show that as a community we feel strongly about the subject and show to whomever is writing the cheques that we are doing the job but could do with a helping hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, Red Hat and Canonical do not have dedicated a11y developers but they¬†&lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;¬†have developers who keep a11y foremost in their minds as they develop and innovate projects for the masses.¬† We don‚Äôt really have that as such.¬† This is where we can reach out to upstream and ask for some help and guidance.¬† Both¬†&lt;a href="http://live.gnome.org/Accessibility" title="GNOME Accessibility Team"&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt;¬†and¬†&lt;a href="http://accessibility.kde.org/" title="KDE Accessibility Team"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;¬†have a11y teams, although it appears that the former is more active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is not an easy topic to tackle.¬† If one doesn‚Äôt understand the tools, how does one ensure the pieces you put together are working?¬† So how about we start learning, and do it well?¬† This is a subject that affects¬†&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;users and developers, and is something that all DEs can jump on and help out.¬† Heck we may even learn a thing or two about how our colleagues/friends/enemies work ;-)¬† It affects us all, and as such we all need to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Eunion feels fairly strongly about Accessibility and as such there are numerous laws in place to try and ensure that users that require it are given an even chance.¬† They have also set up¬†&lt;a href="http://www.aegis-project.eu/" title="AEGIS Project"&gt;AEGIS&lt;/a&gt;¬†to promote a11y usage.¬† In the United states the National Science Foundation is helping to fund¬†&lt;a href="http://hfoss.org/" title="HFOSS Project"&gt;HFOSS&lt;/a&gt;¬†to help the a11y cause.¬† So as you can see there‚Äôs a fairly big push from it from central government.¬† If we don‚Äôt follow their example and neglect to have a11y in our focused sights I fear it could lead to a slippery downward slope for openSUSE.¬† If that sounds melodramatic then maybe it is, but it is something that I honestly do feel could affect us badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick and dirty way to get into a11y is to just enable accessibility in your session.¬† You shouldn‚Äôt notice any difference, if you do then that‚Äôs a bug!¬† File the bug, and make sure you mention that you have a11y enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as a community do you think this is something we could get behind?¬† I would love to see openSUSE 12.0 released as the most accessible distribution; Ubuntu currently makes the statement that they are the most accessible desktop system available and this is a statement I would love to show as false!¬† Not through animosity but through sheer prowess of the Geeko!¬† To do that we (yes that means you at the back, listening to your boom boom music and chatting to your friends on FaceSpace) have to roll our sleeves up and get educated and start educating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not looking for people to nod in agreement with my call for help, that is easy to do.¬† What I‚Äôm looking for is a concerted effort by all in the community to help make us Number 1!¬† There are lots of different ways to do this, but to do so we need to unite as one and work cohesively.¬† So please, help me to help everyone, and make openSUSE that much better!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You have to grant me that I‚Äôm persistent ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so this time round I thought I‚Äôd do a quick round up of some of the feedback that I‚Äôve received so far ‚Äì some of it has been in the form of comments on this here blog, others have been responses on mailing lists, and some has been from direct converstation with me.¬† I‚Äôd love to get more from you, and ultimately you get more from yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is in no particular order, and if anyone has anything else to add then please let me know.¬† Also remember this is a discussion so feel free to discuss sensibly and calmly ‚Äì usual flame ban is in place ;-) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Still a lot of animosity between KDE &amp;amp; GNOME within openSUSE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Community Manager role is too focused on marketing, and not the Community.¬† People would like to see a more operational role, getting involved with the actual project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It is unclear as to what Novell (being the project sponsor) would like from the openSUSE Project, and how do the two fit with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There is a percieved distrust of external contributors, their code isnt good enough etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; openSUSE needs to be pushed more by all parties.¬† There is a distinct lack of overt and covert marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There is too much focus on Novell employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; openSUSE has no clear goal or direction,¬† openSUSE appears to be fumbling along not really sure of what it wants or how to do things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There is too much infrastucture, or the infrastructure isn‚Äôt easy to navigate or understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sometimes we are starting to lag behind upstream and don‚Äôt necessarily keep up with the latest and greatest that is out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is too much reliance on a handful of individuals, there isn‚Äôt a decent spread of knowledge/power amongst teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough ‚Äúfull time‚Äù (I believe Novell employee is meant here) people involved in some teams which are core to both openSUSE and SLE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do you agree with what some of your peers say?¬† If not then step up and let your voice be heard, even if you do let it be known.¬† Remember, as a member of the community you have a chance to influence your surroundings ‚Äì not taking any action will only mean that you are to blame not those that took action that you don‚Äôt agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, I‚Äôm still going at it folks! Let‚Äôs discuss :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time round I‚Äôd like us to discuss Collaboration, Learning, Listening and Leading.¬† Let me clarify what I mean by Collaboration; I‚Äôm¬†&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;¬†talking about Groupwise/Exchange/Zimbra/Alfresco/SharePoint/Kablink style collabortaion, but I¬†&lt;strong&gt;AM&lt;/strong&gt;¬†talking about working with other parties and teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within openSUSE as with other distributions there are multiple teams/projects that in some cases could be classed as competitors ‚Äì GNOME &amp;amp; KDE are a prime example.¬† Just because they are trying to get you to use them doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt have some commonality (other than the underlying OS).¬† I‚Äôd love to see more collaboration with other distributions, working with them on the topic of say RPM as an example.¬† Working with upstream DEs and other distros to improve the likes of a11y (that‚Äôs accessibility for thos that aren‚Äôt aware, you know ‚Äì audio/visual/etc impaired), education. You get the idea?¬† Quite often we need to just look past our differences and get on with the job, soon we‚Äôll realise (hoipefully) that we are pretty much the same the difference is in the implementation.¬† If we focus locally on how we can collaborate within openSUSE alone then we need to work together with a focused vision and take a demographic, say developers, and get everyone interested to chip in with ways of making it easier and better for developers to use openSUSE.¬† Both KDE and GNOME can easily contribute to this, as can documentation gurus and others.¬† The key here is to have a clearly defined target and work together, effectively combining multiple teams into one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about Learning?¬† Well the most obvious way to learn is from history.¬† I‚Äôm not saying we need to dig up the text books from school and see what Claudius Maximus Aurellius did in ancient Rome, but look at the histroy of openSUSE and see what we did right and crucially what we did wrong.¬† Look at it and see if it still applies today and how we can do it right.¬† Another way of learning is from our competitors and counterparts, the likes of Ubuntu, Fedora and all the other distros and projects do some great work (whether one likes to admit it or not).¬† We need to take note of what/how/why they did and see if it applies to us and could we improve it.¬† I think there is too much of a taboo on emulating what others do, if it works then do it!¬† Why on earth should we re-invent the blessed wheel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that we are getting a bit better at is Listening.¬† We‚Äôre not great at it, but the movement is in the right direction.¬† When listening it‚Äôs best to just slow down a touch and actually take stock of what is being said, also take note of how it is being said.¬† The message could get lost or garbled due to the way it is being passed, and if we don‚Äôt focus on listening we may not notice that little fact and end up not really paying attention to the message, when in fact the message is actually very important or beneficial to us.¬† We need to listen to not just our community but also to those communities that we interact with and indirectly depend on ‚Äì I‚Äôm mostly talking about upstream here.¬† There‚Äôs a lot of passive learning to be had from just listening ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to being a Lead, you don‚Äôt have to be a nominated by committee or anything ‚Äì grab the bull by the cahunas and run with it! Go with your instinct, unless you are a complete loonie you will have some reasonable rationale for doing whatever it is and can easily explain to others why/what you are doing.¬† Don‚Äôt be scared, empower yourself and show others that what you‚Äôre doing is cool and actually benefits us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So does anyone have any examples of where we could benefit by collaborating?¬† Or what about how we can improve on the instances where we are already collaborating?¬† What about examples of lessons to be learned from?¬† Yes this could get political and charged, but remember stay calm and focused ‚Äì it‚Äôs easier for people to pay attention that way ;-)¬† How about listening, any examples of where we failed or where we actually got it?¬† I‚Äôd also like to see who you think show good leadership, and also how/why.¬† This isn‚Äôt about who you‚Äôd like to see as the next Chairperson for the board or what ever but people that have grabbed those cahunas and run to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one item that is constant throughout ‚Äì focus!¬† If we stay focused then we can do almost anything, even by me a drink :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/04/06/community-discussion-part-4.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yup, I‚Äôm still trying to get us, the openSUSE Community, to discuss ways we can improve ourselves.¬† This time round I‚Äôm going to look at Education, Coaching and Teamwork.¬† Again there is nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary here, but these are topics I feel are easily forgotten or misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One item that seems to pop up fairly regularily regardless of which side of the fence you‚Äôre on (Novell employee or not), is community contribution and ownership.¬† Basically some people think getting code/packages/whatever into openSUSE is harder than getting a rocking horse to poop.¬† Can I just say it isn‚Äôt ‚Äì honest! You just need to know the process to do it.¬† The flip side of the conversation is, why aren‚Äôt more non-Novellians putting more code and what not into openSUSE?¬† Maybe because they don‚Äôt know or understand the process?¬† So basically we are all to blame, non-Novellians for not asking for help/clarification and Novellians for not going out there and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we educate?¬† Firstly that good old method of documentation, yup it‚Äôs boring and tedious at times but if done right can save a whole load of hassle.¬† It does¬†&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;¬†mean people can just respond to calls for help with RTFM, it mean we have to point people to the correct section of documentaion and also give a little reason as to why they should read it.¬† Documentation isn‚Äôt the only method we can use, after all we are well and truly in the Web 2.0 buzzword bingo era; let‚Äôs use video (screencast/presentation/podcast), anotated images, code examples, comic strips, audio (regular podcast or one offs), and last but not least we could always throw a bit of each into a blog post :-)¬† We need more of the modern methods, they‚Äôre much more palatable and fun from a consumer perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes just having all this information can be daunting, and you can easily get lost in it all.¬† So we need coaching, some gentle guidance and when needed a good slap!¬† If we really want more people to take ownership then let‚Äôs help them take ownership.¬† Just throwing it out there and hoping for the best is good for no-one, and if anything will just create a bad atmosphere and generate friction.¬† Let‚Äôs make sure that those that want to do something get as much help as we can give, it may mean that Novellians have to spend a little bit of time holding people‚Äôs hands but we will all see the gain.¬† Don‚Äôt think that I would expect it all the time, if you take it for granted you won‚Äôt get the oportunity again.¬† So to those that want the help, make sure you make it clear that you do want and need help and also try and calm any fears that it‚Äôs a one off glory hunting mission.¬† It is a commitment from all parties, and you really need to stick with it.¬† It may well be that the best person for coaching you isn‚Äôt a Novell employee, so ask around.¬† We can all teach each other a thing or two.¬† A great example of coaching is Darix and all the others in the Buildservice irc channel and mailing list.¬† Package building can be really daunting, and getting it right can be tricky at times.¬† Those guys and gals there are a huge asset to the community, they‚Äôre friendly and very knowledgable.¬† You just need to not be afraid to ask a question.¬† If you don‚Äôt understand an answer, say so!¬† If you learn something document it and let everyone else know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly try and not go it alone.¬† If you can do something as part of a team, then that‚Äôs a massive win for us all too.¬† You don‚Äôt have to shoulder all the burden, so you reduce the risk of burn out and we reduce the risk of you getting angry and leaving either the thing you were doing or worse off you leaving openSUSE entirely.¬† Getting other people‚Äôs input can most of the time improve things and spreading the workload also means more peoiple have visibility on what is happening.¬† So should you not be able to continue for whatever reason (hopefully a valid one, and not because you‚Äôre bored) then the ball keeps rolling.¬† It also helps with the whole knowledge sharing aspect, everyone learns a bit and as we grow stronger and brighter as a whole.¬† The borg is strong because it is made up of many, we can be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So have you got any examples of where you recieved education/coaching, maybe you had a bad experience trying to get some?¬† Please let me and everyone know.¬† We need to learn from our actions, and if we don‚Äôt know whether they were good or bad how can we improve?¬† If you have an idea on what needs/can be done then discuss it.¬† Remember this isn‚Äôt about me, but about you the openSUSE community.¬† Let‚Äôs step up and really make a difference, and prove to all those naysayers that we do care and are actually doing something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing my series of getting the openSUSE Community engaged in how better to improve itself, I thought I would look at Transparency and Communication.¬† So what do I mean by these two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at the definitions of these two: 
&lt;a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/transparency.html" title="Definition of Transparency"&gt;Transparency&lt;/a&gt;¬†- Lack of hidden agendas¬† and conditions, accompanied by the availability¬† of full¬† information¬† required¬† for collaboration, cooperation, and collective decision making. 
Minimum degree of disclosure to which agreements, dealings, practices, and transactions are open to all for verification. 
Essential condition for a free and open exchange whereby the rules and reasons behind regulatory measures are fair and clear to all participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/communication.html" title="Definition of Communication"&gt;Communication&lt;/a&gt;¬†- Two-way process¬† of reaching mutual¬† understanding, in which participants¬† not only exchange¬† (encode-decode) information¬† but also create¬† and share¬† meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so nothing earth shattering, which is good in so much as it should be relatively easy to attain.¬† No need for spiritual enlightenment.¬† One question I have is, how well do you think openSUSE is at achieving both of these?¬† Personally I think we have come leaps and bounds, but we can still improve (we can always improve ;-) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building of the distribution is done in the open on the OBS, we get regular status updates from the chirpy and cheerful¬†&lt;a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/blog/124" title="Coolo's Blog"&gt;Coolo&lt;/a&gt;¬†on where we are at and what is causing issues.¬† The Board conducts its meeting in the open on irc in #opensuse-project.¬† All the teams conduct their meetings in the open on irc for that matter, well those that have meetings ‚Äì GNOME shall be resuming the regular meetings shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have multiple methods of communication available ‚Äì Mailing lists, IRC, Forums &amp;amp; the booths at events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on the whole I think we are communicating well, but are we communicating the right information and is it &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the information?¬† That‚Äôs where I would like your input :-) ¬† My Only complaint I have is something that pretty much everyone who is passionate suffers from ‚Äì we sometimes let our mouths run off and end up trying to flame someone.¬† Being passionate is great, don‚Äôt ever loose the passion.¬† We just need to harness it, don‚Äôt let it go too wild.¬† Also we need to try and be more respectful to others, not just people but projects and distros.¬† Whether you agree with them or not, there is no need to start throwing abuse or any form of nastiness.¬† By all means disagree with them but do so in a calm and collected manner, you will be respected for it much more.¬† If you do get carried away, then for goodness sake admit it and apologise!¬† Everyone is guilty of this to an extent, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for transparency, I think we are certainly on the right track.¬† Almost everything is now done in the open, I‚Äôm not aware of anything done behind closed doors, again let me know if there is any.¬† If there is we need to know what and crucially why.¬† Yes I accept that there are occaisions where some things need to be done in relative secrecy but we need to try and keep those to a minimum and there needs to be a good reason for it ‚Äì financial/legal/etc implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please if you have any comments on either communication or transparency then let‚Äôs have them.¬† Without them things will just tick along as they are, and possibly degrade (hopefully there will be none of the latter but‚Ä¶.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that are about to start shouting at me about iFolder.¬† Yes it is an old issue that is much more complicated to resolve, there are layers of old school Novell involved and as such it makes things much more complicated.¬† Also it isn‚Äôt part of the openSUSE Project it is a Novell project, which is also another reason I believe that things haven‚Äôt been resolved.¬† Should it be covered by the Geeko‚Äôs fine umberella?¬† What can be done to improve things?¬† How can we communicate with those that are responsible?¬† As¬†&lt;a href="http://shotofjaq.org/" title="The Shot Of Jaq podcast"&gt;Jono and Aq&lt;/a&gt;¬†say ‚Äì this is only the start of the conversation.¬† It‚Äôs up to you to to keep it going and find the answers you are looking for!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a couple of weeks since my¬†&lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/03/09/community-discussion-part1.html" title="Community Discussion - Part 1"&gt;first Discussion with the Community&lt;/a&gt;, so as a follow on I thought I would cover the topic of Tools for the community.¬† In my mind I split tools into two groups ‚Äì hard &amp;amp; soft.¬† What I mean by this is ‚Äúhard‚Äù = infrastructure based, and ‚Äúsoft‚Äù = software based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may seem pretty obvious to you, and some may seem like they aren‚Äôt tools at all.¬† So to clarify what my definition of a tool is ‚Äì something that enables or facilitates the completion of a task.¬† So that gives the ‚ÄúTool‚Äù a pretty big scope :-) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as a community we have a lot of good tools already available to us.¬† One of the problems is that we don‚Äôt really know about them or we‚Äôve forgotten about them.¬† So as a refresher here are the ‚Äúhard‚Äù tools (no childish snickering please ;-) ) I can think of, if you notice any that I‚Äôve missed out please let me know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href="http://opensuse.blip.tv/" title="See presentations etc from the openSUSE community"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a good mix of tools hosted on Novell infrastructure and that hosted outside of Novell.¬† For instance the Source code is actually on the Gitorious service, why should we have to maintain our own DVCS when there are open services available?¬† Also with the Video, we use Blip.tv and will also add YouTube to the toolset for distribution of openSUSE video.¬† The Planet is hosted on a community owned and run server as is the Community Wiki and package search.¬† So you can‚Äôt say we are wholly reliant on Novell :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment I don‚Äôt see anything that we‚Äôre missing, but I‚Äôm sure something will crop up and then we‚Äôll go ‚ÄúAh if only we had XYZ‚Äù, but when that happens we can look and see what best fits the bill and try and fix it.¬† The only complaint I think we have is that the integration between the tools isn‚Äôt as good as it could or should be.¬† This is something that has been picked up on so don‚Äôt worry too much, the Boosters are working hard to make things blend naturally.¬† So it will happen, just not over night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so that covers the infrastructure bits, what about the software side of things?¬† Well whilst at the Novell offices in Nurenberg for HackWeeKII, there was a discussion about how to get more people involved in the actual coding of things.¬† Some of the Novellians were curious as to why no-one was willing to actually pick up some of the code and start sending in patches.¬† Well I‚Äôd like to recommend we look at another big project at Novell, and also to some of the big upstream projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly the other project is the Mono Project, those that want to spout holier than thou rubbish can just STFU and do that now!¬† The Mono guys &amp;amp; gals have made¬†&lt;a href="http://http//www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html" title="Get the latest Mono goodness"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;¬†Virtual Machine images, Live CDs, as well as the required packages.¬† They include all the required tools to develop with Mono, and also exmple applications and also code so that you can get going real fast.¬† They have effectivly created a Mono Developer‚Äôs Kit, but crucially they use openSUSE and they do a fantastic job of pimping the Geeko! Thanks Mono Project, you‚Äôre doing a sterling job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly we have recently seen that KDE have created their¬†&lt;a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2010/03/plasma-netbook-reference-platform_15.html" title="Aaron Siego announcing the Plasma Netbook Reference Platform"&gt;Plasma Netbook Reference Platform&lt;/a&gt;¬†using openSUSE &amp;amp; our tools, so if anyone wants to look at, tinker with, hack, or do whatever with it they can and easily.¬† GNOME have a¬†&lt;a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDeveloperKit" title="The GNOME Developer Kit"&gt;Developer Kit&lt;/a&gt;¬†available thanks to the fine Foresight folks (with a whole lot of love from¬†&lt;a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/" title="THE Foresight &amp;amp; rPath man"&gt;Og Maciel&lt;/a&gt;).¬† It gives everything one needs to get to developing for the GNOME Environment.¬† Og has also taken the step and started to create a¬†&lt;a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=828" title="Og's Django Developer Kit"&gt;Developer Kit for Django&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my little mind is starting to tick, and this to those that know me well is always slightly dangerous :-) ¬† Why don‚Äôt we follow these examples, and provide language and function specific developer kits?¬† Prove to people that it isn‚Äôt difficult to make the switch to develop for their preferred language or what ever on openSUSE, give them Live &amp;amp; Installable ISOs, give them VM images. Give them the tools needed to get the job done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could always pimp these developer kits at the specific language conferences like PyCon, RailsConf etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have many programming experts within the community, so why don‚Äôt we pull from that expertise?¬† Let‚Äôs get openSUSE Developer kits for Java, Python, Qt, Python, Ruby, PHP, and any other language you think is beneficial.¬† This isn‚Äôt about what language is better than the next, it is about getting the message out and showing everyone that it really isnt hard to use openSUSE as your preferred platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that I‚Äôve said my piece, what tools do people think we are missing?¬† Also what issues do people have with our current tool set?¬† For goodness sake don‚Äôt just grumble about things let‚Äôs discuss constructively so we can fix things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bad workman always blames his tools, a good workman utilises his tools to their full extent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Bugging Bugs - A Call For Help</title>
    <published>2010-03-14T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2010-03-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/03/14/bugging-bugs-a-call-for-help.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Personally I find that in Linux or any OS for that matter, keeping track of and dealing with bugs can be a real PITA.¬† This may be in part that I‚Äôm not a power user of the services available (they don‚Äôt make it obvious how to fully utilise their service); also there are so many different types of bug trackers out there ‚Äì bugzilla, trac, mantis, etc; it is also down to so many different projects use their own tracker; one advantage is that code/project hosting sites have their own ‚Äì SourceForge, Gna!, launchpad, BerliOS, etc.¬† So all projects under these use the same tool/interface.¬† Yes bugzilla is probably the most common, but it is also one of the most modified ‚Äì no two projects using it are the same and the work flow differs as much as the visuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an illustration, I am active or have a keen interest in openSUSE &amp;amp; Bongo.¬† One uses a customised version of Bugzilla and the other uses GNA!‚Äôs Savane.¬† As a result, I am also in contact with a multitude of other projects (GNOME, KDE, Freedesktop.org, Moblin, Gwibber to name a few).¬† These all have their own bug trackers on different services, so to add them to the original two means I have at least seven different tracking services to deal with.¬† My dealings range from filing bugs, to monitoring a bug for information and even the odd occaison where I am assigned a bug to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know they all pump out emails when something changes to the bug, but having to hunt through my email to get bug ids or whatever is annoying to say the least, not to mention filling up my inbox.¬† One big gripe is with people adding themselves to the CC list; do I really care if Chief Umbuzweiluh has added himself to the CC list for a particular bug? No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what I would like is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  An application that can either sit on my desktop or in the notification panel that can help me manage all my bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The app would need to be cross desktop friendly, so that it doesn‚Äôt look out of place on whichever DE I‚Äôm using ‚Äì yes I do use more than one :-) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Ideally offer some form of offline functionality ‚Äì caching/storing the information locally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I don‚Äôt care what language it is written in, something that anyone can understand would be handy, heck I may even contribute some code if it is easy enough ;-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Support multiple backends, as I said I use lots of different trackers so getting the bulk of them supported would be ideal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I mention ‚Äúoffline‚Äù I would ideally like to have read write access so that I can then update a bug say if I‚Äôm on the move and then the app syncs with the backend next time I‚Äôm online.¬† I appreciate this may be harder to implement so I‚Äôd be happy with read only access.¬† Basically the sort of information I‚Äôd like to see is something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;|Tracker(1)|BugID(2)|Summary(3)|Status(4)|Role(5)|Product(6)Priority(7)|Severity(8)| (9)|-(10)|&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Which bug tracker is it on ‚Äì Novell, GNOME, Launchpad, KDE, etc. Ideally show the logo of the tracker but if not a short text ‚Äì BNC, BGO, LP, BKO, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The bug number, ideally as a hyperlink so that it can be pasted into and email or IM conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The bug summary. Basically whatever is put into the summary field of the bug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The status of the bug ‚Äì New, Assigned, Re-Opened, Unconfirmed, NeedInfo, Closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What is your role with the bug ‚Äì Reporter, Asignee, CC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What product is the bug against.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What is the bug‚Äôs priority ‚Äì Urgent, High, Normal, Low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What is the bug‚Äôs severuty ‚Äì Critical, Major, Normal, Minor, Trivial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Add a bug by either ID or url.¬† In an ideal world one would even be able to generate the whole thing from scratch and when you add it it create the ticket on the service and fills in the bug id for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove a bug. If one is on the CC list it would unsubscribe you from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôm no code monkey I have no real idea on¬†&lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;¬†to implement my idea, but what I do know is¬†&lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt;¬†I would like.¬† I would be more than happy for an app that just provided the above mentioned table, but in an ideal world the app would also provide the full conversation of the bug showing all comments and any attachments.¬† Baby steps first, get the basic information available then add features as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I would love for the app to do the notifying of bug changes for me so I can disable all the email notifications I get.¬† So having some form of notification area presence would be great, and even providing a bubble when something does change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;| N / BNC(1)|12345(2)|Foo Bar Noob(3) | &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Logo or ID of bug tracker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Bug ID ‚Äì clickable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What has changed ‚Äì this could be Status, Role, Product, Priority, Severity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now depending on how the app works will depend on what happens when one clicks on the bug id. Is there functionality for full context (fat app) or will it just open up in a browser.¬† The intial services I would like to see are (in priority) ‚Äì Bugzilla, Savane, Launchpad, Trac, Sourceforge, and then anyting else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So does anyone fancy being my hero and coding this for me?¬† It would be great if we could get this as part of GSoC ‚Äì I‚Äôll add it to openFate and the wiki ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone knows of something that exists that provides this functionality please let me know.¬† Chris Lamb did create a GNOME Applet for the Debian BTS tracker that kind of did this so if it helps have a look¬†&lt;a href="http://chris-lamb.co.uk/projects/debian-bts-applet/" title="Lamby's BTS Applet"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;¬†for the code.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Community Discussion - Part1</title>
    <published>2010-03-09T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2010-03-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/03/09/community-discussion-part1.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be a good idea to try and engage you ‚Äì the fine openSUSE community ‚Äì in discussion about ‚ÄúUs‚Äù the Community.¬† We seemed to have been spoiled by having a Community Manager, people kind of seemed to let him do the work or worse expected him to do so.¬† Now that we don‚Äôt have that position any more we need to go back to basics and start rolling our sleeves up.¬† We‚Äôve started but we have much to do.¬† As such this is the first in I‚Äôm not sure how many posts on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save me having to repeat myself constantly I‚Äôll do a small disclaimer now: 
&lt;strong&gt;THESE ARE MY OPINIONS AND THOUGHTS AND NOT GOSPEL! I AM NOT EMPLOYED BY NOVELL! I WANT TO GET A DISCUSSION GOING NOT A FLAME WAR!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion this topic is linked to my previous post about the ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/02/17/planning-for-the-future.html" title="blog post on planning for the future"&gt;Planning For The Future&lt;/a&gt;‚Äú.¬† The key here is to remain agile, able to flex, roll, bounce, jump and basically move with the times.¬† If we impose strict rigid requirements then things will start to crack and crumble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do I see as key items needed to enable more community contributions, and get more non-Novellians involved in taking a more (pro)active role in the Project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- we need an enabler of sorts that lets people start off small and get to grips with how things move, from there they can grow out and up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- ensuring that the decisions that are made are clear concise and understandable.¬† I‚Äôm ure not everyone will like the decisions but if they can see the reasons behind it then they can work with it and maybe come up with a better alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Communicate&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- this is something that has improved a lot over time but still has some ways to go.¬† There are certain parties that still don‚Äôt understand how to communicate with the wider community but they can and are an integral part of the ecosystem, we need to educate and help them get better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Coach&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- no-one can get to a suitable proficiency in any subject whether it be academic/sporting/whatever without some form of tutelage.¬† To help lighten the work load on the employees that are trying to juggle between their enterprise workload and community workload we need to have them spend some time away from their corporate duties to help with some knowledge and skill sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Teamwork&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- stop depending on individuals, whether they are Novellian or non-Novellian one person can‚Äôt do it all in their supposed subject matter of expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Educate&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- self market, not just to the outside world but internally too.¬† The openSUSE community is too modest for it‚Äôs own good at times, we need to be more vocal about all the fantastic stuff we do.¬† We have to be clear and concise in the message we send out across the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Learn&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- look at our peers and take a leaf out of their book sometimes.¬† Believe it or not they do do things right sometimes ;-) I‚Äôm not saying copy, but try and take the bits that are needed and roll it into what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Collaborate&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- work with our peers on universal matters.¬† This doesn‚Äôt just mean cross-desktop, but also cross-project and cross-distro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Listen&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- take a moment to hear what is being said.¬† Just taking that little bit of extra time can help isolate the noise from the message and help you understand what is being said/asked.¬† Remember that not everyone is a native speaker of your language so things might get lost/confused in translation, which is where that little bit of time will help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Lead&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- you don‚Äôt have to do things by committee.¬† If you see something that needs/can be done just do it!¬† We dither around far too much waiting for someone else to do it.¬† Do what you can and then communicate what you‚Äôve done and what if anything is outstanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above link into one another almost inextricably, so not doing one will most likely have an detrimental effect on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have several items that are great examples of how the community can get on and do something great, a sample of those are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;openSUSE Education&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- this team started from very little and have created one of the best educational derivatives of any distro.¬† There is a good mix of people involved, and no-one is paid to do it, even on the Novell side.¬† They‚Äôre a well knit team of contributors that are more than happy to help people wanting to help them. They saw a gap and filled it, by taking a leaf out of one of our peers‚Äô book and enhanced it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Packman&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- the great resource for the common user.¬† They are one of the oldest community based projects relating to openSUSE or its earlier iterations that I remember.¬† They‚Äôre approachable friendly and have a heck of a lot of knowledge.¬† They saw a need and did it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;LXDE&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- a new desktop environment that is only a couple of years old.¬† It has effectively been packaged from scratch by one person and is now included in Factory and the upcoming 11.3 release.¬† There was no committee discusion about doe we want it in or should we have it in, there was an opportunity and it was capitalised on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I‚Äôd love to hear from people on what they think is missing or blocking them from doing any/all of the above, I‚Äôd also like to know what it is that people find awkward or difficult in joining in and being more active.¬† Don‚Äôt get me wrong I appreciate one of the most precious and costly commodities is pretty much standard across the board ‚Äì that of time.¬† I suffer from that problem as much as anyone, but it doesn‚Äôt stop me from contributing, sometimes I just ave to slow down and trickle the contributions rather than pour them.¬† So let‚Äôs start the conversation and get ideas and complaints out in the open.¬† If you don‚Äôt say it how are people going to know about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that this is an open dialogue.¬† Pot shots, defamation of character, flaming, and anything non-constructive will NOT be tolerated.¬† Let‚Äôs keep it clean and helpful.¬† Listing things that our peers do better than us and also what they do worse than us would most likely open eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How one gets to the future greatly depends on how one deals with the present and learns from the past.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Planning For The Future</title>
    <published>2010-02-17T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2010-02-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/02/17/planning-for-the-future.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been over a week now since I came back from the fantabulous FOSDEM, and have had a chance to digest a lot of the conversations I had whilst there. One of the conversations I had was with a senior developer who was in a sort of Special Interest Group. He mentioned to me that his management had asked the SIG to formulate a plan for where they wanted to see their project in five years, and how they aimed to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I thought about that idea for a while, and to be honest I find it a¬†&lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt;¬†difficult question to answer properly. So I thought I‚Äôd ask my fellow community members (whether that‚Äôs openSUSE, Bongo or whatever) how would you answer that question in relation to your chosen project? I can invariably only come up with a partial answer, not a full where and how. Let me try and show you what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll take¬†&lt;a href="http://bongo-project.org/" title="The Bongo Project - simple e-mail &amp;amp; calendaring"&gt;Bongo&lt;/a&gt;¬†as my first example. For those that have no idea what Bongo is let me explain: Bongo is an evolution of some forward thinking by some people who used to work at Novell. It started out as the Hula Project; then Novell sold the related assets off due to strategy alignments (or whatever); a few of us wanted to continue and forked the code and created the Bongo Project. OK so that‚Äôs a brief history but what is it? Bongo is a lightweight and simple e-mail &amp;amp; calendaring solution, it is based on proven technology ‚Äì the heritage goes back to NIMS if I‚Äôm not mistaken. Whoopee do there are like a million and one e-mail solutions out there. Yes but not all in one solutions that are light on resources and contain all functions. Bongo is NOT a groupware product, it is aimed at SMBs, geeks education and pretty much anyone that just wants e-mail, calendaring and contacts. Think of it as a FOSS solution to provide the functionality of Gmail Google Calendar. Here endeth the history lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the example. So I need to list where I would like to see Bongo in five years time, OK how about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Used by a large number of education and SMBs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Shipped with all the major distributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Mimicked but never beaten by potential competitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Partnering with other projects to maximise reach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Leading edge web front end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Hooks for multiple languages/frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Large developer community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Large user community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Global domination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the trickier part ‚Äì how to achieve those goals. So far all I can come up with is (in no particular order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Canvas more developers that are interested in the e-mail/calendaring space to join in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Advertise and market Bongo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Actually get a working WebUI done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Look at existing solutions and try and learn from them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Speak to distributions and see if they can help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Win the lottery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the list for where is larger than the list for how. Sure I could expand the latter a bit by being more detailed but this is supposed to be a bullet list with summaries not an essay. In my view one needs to get a list to work from and then expand on it, maybe even categorising the bullet points to see what/how/where/when and also explaining why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Bongo is a relatively simple project with a small user base and community, and a very defined focus. The other project that I‚Äôm involved in and care for is openSUSE, and lord knows that is no simple beast :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me try the same with¬†&lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org/" title="The openSUSE Project - home of the Geeko"&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt;. The where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  At the forefront of distributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Large developer base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Better toolsets for developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Working better and closer with fellow distributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Have a foundation that manages the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Get more community contributors involved to lessen the load on Novellians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Learn from other projects to help improve us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Keep momentum going&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Grow the user base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  World domination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  More active marketing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Speaking to developers of different projects to find ut what they feel is missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Win the lottery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see I‚Äôm woefully short on how on earth I am to achieve anything.¬† I‚Äôm open to suggestions :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know for a fact that there may be one or two items that I‚Äôve listed that could be contentious, and do you know what? I sincerely hope so :-) Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really do appreciate and am grateful for all the work effort and money that Novell has invested in openSUSE; but it isn‚Äôt fair at all for Novell to keep carrying the Project. If anyone thinks they‚Äôre not, you are living in lala land. Sure some of it might be their own doing, but a lot isn‚Äôt and it is up to us the community help them so that we can benefit even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really do hope people start thinking, and doing it seriously about where they would like to see their preferred project in five years time. I would also love to see people‚Äôs responses as to Where &amp;amp; How they would do it. Anyone that starts screaming like my 21month old daughter about this or that will get a sound thrashing and ignored. There is absolutely¬†&lt;strong&gt;ZERO&lt;/strong&gt;¬†room for pettiness in the community. If you disagree with something then great! Just make sure you are as detailed and as calm as possible about why and also how you propose to do it differently. This doesn‚Äôt just apply to this whole five year plan thing, but to general discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt loose your passion, just learn to use your passion ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/02/03/story-telling-your-gitorious-exploits.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, I‚Äôm actually enjoying my¬†&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/" title="Life streaming how you want"&gt;Storytlr&lt;/a&gt;¬†install ‚Äì maybe enjoy isn‚Äôt the right word but you get my drift, don‚Äôt you?¬† Well I was determined to loose my coding virginity, and Storytlr‚Äôs plugin system seemed to be the safest way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to base my plugin on an existing plugin, and my two options were creating a¬†&lt;a href="http://blip.tv/" title="Next Generation TV Network"&gt;Blip.tv&lt;/a&gt;¬†plugin (based on the¬†&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/" title="Video Sharing For You"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;¬†plugin) or a¬†&lt;a href="http://gitorious.org/" title="Open Source Git hosting"&gt;Gitorious&lt;/a&gt;¬†plugin based on the¬†&lt;a href="http://github.com/" title="Social Source code hosting"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;¬†plugin).¬† Guess which one I chose? No, not the Blip.tv one dufus!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can now present you with the shiny new Gitorious plugin for Storytlr.¬† You can grab the code from¬†&lt;a href="http://github.com/awafaa/storytlr-plugin-gitorious" title="Gitorious plugin for storytlr"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.¬† Yes I am acutely aware of the irony of hosting the code for this on Github :-) but to be honest for a coding dunce like moi, Github makes it easier.¬† Oh and the fact that the active developers are on Github makes things easier (for branching etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, just to prove it does work here‚Äôs a little snap of it in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2730/4328844248_94ef55f621_o.png" alt="Screenshot of my Gitorious plugin for Storytlr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to give big props to¬†&lt;a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/" title="Velvet cach of Omaha"&gt;John Hobbs&lt;/a&gt;¬†whos code I aped, and who code reviewed and fixed up my syntax ‚Äì thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm off to Brussels in the morning for¬†&lt;a href="http://fosdem.org/2010/" title="Best FOSS meetup in Europe"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;, so I might/might not get round to doing my second plugin.¬† If you‚Äôre there look me up :-) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Storytelling with Storytlr</title>
    <published>2010-01-29T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2010-01-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/2010/01/29/storytelling-with-storytlr.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be wise to document how I installed¬†&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/" title="Life streaming"&gt;Storytlr&lt;/a&gt;¬†as I feel the official¬†&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/wiki/Install" title="Storytlr official documentation"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;¬†doesn‚Äôt list everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic requirements to get storytlr working are ‚Äì Apache, MySQL, PHP5 (with php5-tidy, and php5-mcrypt).¬† So once you have the basic system requirements met, the next step is to download the latest stable release from¬†&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/storytlr/downloads/list" title="Download storytlr"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;¬†and extract the tarball in your target directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in your virtual host file make sure you have enabled¬†&lt;code&gt;AllowOverride&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I set mine to ALL), this will mean that apache takes note of the .htaccess.¬† I also had to add¬†&lt;code&gt;Options FollowSymlinks&lt;/code&gt; to the .htaccess, just underneath .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next create your database using your preferred method (phpmyadmin/mysqladmin/voodoo).¬† Once created you need to populate it with the basic info, so¬†&lt;code&gt;cd¬†$PATH/TO/INSTALL/protected/install/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and run &lt;code&gt;mysql -u $USER -p -D $DB_NAME &amp;lt; database.sql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the database is ready and waiting for you now, next step is to edit the basic config information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a sample file ready for you to edit, so first thing is¬†&lt;code&gt;cd $PATH/TO/INSTALL/protected/config/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and copy the sample¬†&lt;code&gt;cp config.ini.sample config.ini&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open config.ini in your preferred editor. The key items to change are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.host=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äîyou can leave this if your database is running on the same host as you web server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.username=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìenter the database username for the storytlr database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.password=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìenter the database user password for the storytlr database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.dbname=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìenter the database name for the storytlr database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;security.cookie=&lt;/code&gt;   &amp;lt;‚Äìyou can replace all or part of this if you wish, just make it different to what is there already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;web.host=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìenter your desired web url without the http:// (i.e. stream.geeko.org).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;web.timezone=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìput your desired/local timezone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;debug=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìit is advisable to change this to 1.  It will help you when you run into issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;flickr.api_keys=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìyou will need to add your api key here if you wish to use the flickr module.  You can get your key by heading &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/" title="Flikr key generation"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;twitter.username=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìadd your twitter credentials if you want items * to be posted to twitter (i.e. blog entries/etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;twitter.password=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìadd your twitter credentials if you want items to be posted to twitter (i.e. blog entries/etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gmap.key=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äì same as flickr you need to add your api key here to use the map functionality.  You can get your key from &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/" title="Google Maps key generation"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;default.timezone=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìagain change it to your preferred/local timezone. If you‚Äôre not sure you can leave the default and change it via the admin panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;default.timezoneid=&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;lt;‚Äìagain change it to your preferred/local timezone.  If you‚Äôre not sure you can leave the default and change it via the admin panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally make sure you web server has the correct permissions to access the files&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;chown -R wwwrun:www $PATH/TO/INSTALL&lt;/code&gt; (replace &lt;code&gt;wwwrun:www&lt;/code&gt; with whatever your distro uses if not on openSUSE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So once all that is done just head over to your new site.  You can log in via the little key icon in the top right or just append /admin to your url.  The default credentials are &lt;code&gt;user=admin password=storytlr&lt;/code&gt; please make sure you change the password once logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that‚Äôs the install done, what about making sure the feeds saty up to date?  Well the only way of doing that is to set up a cronjob, not painful at all but not as automated as I‚Äôd have liked.  I‚Äôve chosen to update every 7 minutes because there is so much going on in my web 2.0 life :-P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically choose your timing for updating your streams, and then run the update.php script located in the protected/tools directory telling it which user to update for.  My cronjob looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*/7 * * * * php5 $PATH/TO/INSTALL/protected/tools/update.php admin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several additional plugins available:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/storytlr-plugin-github" title="Storytlr Github Plugin"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/storytlr-plugin-goodreads" title="Storytlr Goodreads Plugin"&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/jmhobbs/storytlr-plugin-foursquare" title="Storytlr Foursquare Plugin"&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each plugin has instructions on how to install, but they are pretty simple.  In essence you‚Äôll need to do a git clone of the repository housing the plugin, rename the directory, add the database entries to you installation, copy the icon to the images directory, and off you go!  If you are interested in creating a new plugin, I recommend you look at John Hobbs‚Äô little &lt;a href="http://www.velvetcache.org/2010/01/19/writing-a-plugin-for-storytlr" title="Writing a plugin for Storytlr"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://seg.phault.net/" title="The home of Segphault"&gt;Ryan Paul&lt;/a&gt; of Ars Technica and Gwibber fame did a &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/guides/2010/01/make-your-own-lifestream-with-open-source-software.ars" title="Ars Technica article on Storytlr"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on storytlr which pushed me to trying it.  As you can see from Ryan‚Äôs site he has implemented a few modifications like tangofying the icon set, and also looks like he created a Launchpad plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few issues but none of them are in anyway show stoppers, and I'm actually enjoying the simplicity of it all :-D&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK so I‚Äôve finally got round to getting this domain back up after nuking the server, problem is it isn‚Äôt back on the server but on my secondary and much less bandwidth friendly machine.¬† So if you want to download anything please be aware it will take¬†&lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt;¬†longer than it did in the past ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see (if you¬†&lt;a href="http://andrew.wafaa.eu/" title="European Wafaa"&gt;visit directly&lt;/a&gt;¬†rather than through an rss reader) I am now running¬†&lt;a href="http://storytlr.googlecode.com/" title="Storytlr's home page"&gt;Storytlr&lt;/a&gt;.¬† Basically I was in the mood for a change and as I use twitter a lot now I thought it best to just pull all my inane ramblings on the net into one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that actually thought I had some useful content on my old blog don‚Äôt fret, you can still access it all either by using the search function on the new site or head over to my archive¬†&lt;a href="http://archive.wafaa.eu/" title="My archive of my old blog"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
