No, I’m not talking about [this board][1] – I’m talking about the cool project by GNOME afficianado [Lucas Rocha][2] – [The Board][3].

There is a little gotcha with the packages – it is for openSUSE Factory/11.4 only at the moment. I need to work on backporting some of the shiny dependencies to 11.3.

Things aren’t 100%, as I need to do a tiny bit of cleaning up with the packages, but it works pretty well for a 0.1.0 release ![;-)][5]
