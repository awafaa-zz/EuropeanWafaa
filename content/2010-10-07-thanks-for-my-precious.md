So after many months of hard work, [Smeegol is out the door][1].  Now contrary to what some folk may think, this was \*NOT\* a one man show – far from it!  I may have spearheaded the whole affair, but I in no way can take credit for it all – that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t accept any of your fine donations ;-)

I’d like to take this opportunity to thank many of the people that helped get this labour of love out the door.  Without them I most likely would still be floundering around, working out my backside from my elbow. This truely shows how great not just the openSUSE community is but also the wider open source & Linux community is in general.  So with out further delay, I’d like to thank the following people (in alphabetical order):

Aaron Bockover

Alan McGovern

Andrea Florio

Andreas Jaeger

Bertrand Lorenz

Bin Li

Dominique Leuenberger

Federico Mena-Quintero

Gabriel Burt

Gary Lin

Guy Lunardi

Jackub Steiner

James Tan

Joey Li

Jos Poortvliet

JP Rosevear

Marcus Ruckert

Michael Meeks

This list is by no means exhaustive, I would also like to thank the following projects in general:
