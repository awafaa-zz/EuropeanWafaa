After five years at [Fujitsu][1] it is time for me to move on. I’ve had a blast, both good and bad, whilst there and was lucky enough to have experienced and hopefully learnt a lot. Whist there I’ve worked in all sorts of verticals; including but not limited to Government, Financial, Education, Science and HPC. Although I was brought in to deal with Linux and Open Source it was never limited to that and was lucky enough to have been exposed to a multitude of technologies that I wouldn’t have known about had it not been due to work.

I’m no longer going to be based from home, but will be based out of the fine city of Cambridge working for [ARM][2]. As for what I’m going to do exactly, all I’ll say is that it is going to be very much Open Source related (which makes me happier than a pig in poo!). I will be on leave until I start my new role, which is when I’ll tell more. I am confident that I wont need to curtail my involvement with openSUSE, if anything I will have to start getting involved with many more projects. I’m really excited at the prospect of working with other distributions, the folks at Linaro, ARM’s partners, and the wider community.

Until then, have a lot of fun folks ![:-)][3]
