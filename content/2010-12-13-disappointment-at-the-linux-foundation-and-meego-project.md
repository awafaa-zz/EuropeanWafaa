I’ve been stewing over a response on the MeeGo developers mailing list for some time now.  Basically the MeeGo Project and their steward, the Linux Foundation don’t seem to be wanting to play this whole open source, open community game.  I wouldn’t have any issue with it if it was just Nokia and Intel fumbling with MeeGo, it would be just another lost opportunity that big corporations screwed up on.  Problem is the Linux Foundation is involved and are supposedly the ones guiding the project.

In case you don’t know, before I released Smeegol I asked some questions on the MeeGo Dev list with regards to what openSUSE can/can’t do/use.  That kind of went nowhere.  Fedora have also tried asking and again got nowhere.  [Debian have also asked][1], and after seven weeks the[Linux Foundation answered][2].

 [1]: http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-October/479228.html "Debian requesting info from MeeGo"
 [2]: http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2010-December/480512.html "the LF's response to Debian"

In all honesty, I was insensed by the response. I spoke to my counterparts at Fedora and they too echoed my feelings. To allow those in the openSUSE and wider community who aren’t subscribed to the MeeGo lists I’ll provide my response.  For those in a rush:

**tl;dr** - Don’t think MeeGo, don’t say MeeGo, don’t contribute to MeeGo unless it is on our terms, don’t use MeeGo unless it is on our crippled distro, MeeGo is going it alone.

For those that want to see me rant some more:

Seven weeks to effectively turn around and say “No, no, no”?  I’m sorry  
if I sound bitter or angry; but the truth of the matter is that I’m  
actually fairly disgusted with how the Linux Foundation, Nokia and Intel  
have all acted towards the wider Linux community.  For all the talk of  
openness at the conference in Dublin all I see are closed doors and  
barricades.

I’m sorry but do you honestly think that users who install the MeeGo UX  
on a distro be it openSUSE, Fedora, Debian or whichever are going to  
think that it has come from the MeeGo project?  This doesn’t happen for  
any open source project that is available via a distribution. GNOME, KDE  
etc welcome inclusion into distros and want downstream involvement.  Why  
do you feel that MeeGo doesn’t?

Trying to paint all users with a stupid brush is wrong and condescending  
to both users and distros.  You appear to be missing a key factor that  
myself and my counterparts are doing here – marketing MeeGo and enabling  
the wider community to get involved and help make MeeGo better.  Why  
should a developer have to install a new distro to be able to contribute  
to the codebase?

Having meego in a package name shows where the upstream contribution  
comes from.  Just like with packages from Google etc.  This is the most  
basic form of attribution, and is only right.  Why are you trying to  
force people to fork?  Yes, fork.  If you don’t want people to recognise  
your work and re-use it with almost no changes why have it in the open?

Linux users and especially developers can be fickle, they find a distro  
they like and stick to it – quite often they are more faithful to their  
distro than they are to their partner or loved one.  Forcing them to  
choose between distro or contributing to MeeGo the chances are they’ll  
stick to their distro of choice.

When Moblin was around, it was one of three things – a User eXperience,  
a distribution and a reference platform.  This worked well, so why have  
you changed it?

This fanatical enforcement of the MeeGo trademark is going to do more  
damage than good.  People have asked me what’s different between MeeGo’s  
trademark guidelines and openSUSE’s, and the simple answer is it is the  
execution of the trademark that sets us apart.  Thinking that people are  
going to get “confused” between Smeegol and MeeGo is ludicrous.  Sure  
I’m not a lawyer/solicitor or any other form of legal professional, but  
I don’t need to be to apply common sense.

We are trying to promote MeeGo and further it in an already crowded  
space.  Making us change package names, and removing any reference to  
MeeGo gives you absolutely zero visibility.  At the end of the day,  
openSUSE and the other distros have a much wider reach than MeeGo does,  
and possibly ever will as a stand alone distro.

I have tried several times to discuss these issues, and have even tried  
going off list to facilitate the dialogue in a more protected manner.  
MeeGo is far from open to the community, if I was an ISV or ISV then  
sure it maybe more open but from what I’ve heard even partners have a  
tough time.

Being an exclusive project is a sure way to failure. Try being  
inclusive, you’ll have more chance of succeeding.  If you don’t want  
community participation that’s fine, re-license to something proprietary  
and you wont get bothered by those that want to help.  Yes you have  
already re-licensed some code from open licenses to proprietary ones  
without any announcement to the community, not a great open gesture.

I don’t see a single question or answer in that FAQ, just a statement.  
Not especially helpful to the community.
