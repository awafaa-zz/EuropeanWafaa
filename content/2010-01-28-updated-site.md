OK so I’ve finally got round to getting this domain back up after nuking the server, problem is it isn’t back on the server but on my secondary and much less bandwidth friendly machine.  So if you want to download anything please be aware it will take **much** longer than it did in the past ;-)

As you can see (if you [visit directly][2] rather than through an rss reader) I am now running [Storytlr][3].  Basically I was in the mood for a change and as I use twitter a lot now I thought it best to just pull all my inane ramblings on the net into one place.

For those that actually thought I had some useful content on my old blog don’t fret, you can still access it all either by using the search function on the new site or head over to my archive [here][4]. Enjoy!
