So HackWeek VII has been and gone, but work has not stopped in getting our beloved Geeko some ARMs.

Now I’ll be the first to admit, things have been a wee bit scrappy in places. This isn’t anyone’s fault, it’s just that we want to get things rolling ASAP. Thing is, we need more haste less speed; we need to be somewhat more concerted with our efforts. So instead of trying to get everything to build in one hit (would be great if that was possible), we are going to target patterns of packages.

With that in mind Joop Boonen was good enough to pull up a list of the packages required to build the Jeos pattern, I’ve added it to the [wiki][1] in a table to show the status of the required packages. If you would like to help out, look at the the [Jeos Package List page][2] and add your name in the column and when you submit a fix pop the SR number in too.

 [2]: http://en.opensuse.org/Jeos_ARM_Package_List "Jeos package list"

Once we have the Jeos list complete, we can then move on as each subsequent package set will build on this. Next up will be the Minimal X, after that we get onto the big bad boys of GNOME/KDE/LXDE/XFCE.

One item that is holding us back is hardware – we are encountering a whole heap of issues with Qemu, which takes time to resolve and as such takes time away from getting things working. So please help us out by donating as much or as little as you can to the effort.
