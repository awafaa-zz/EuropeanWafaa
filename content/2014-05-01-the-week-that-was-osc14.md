So that was the week that was. As with almost all good things, openSUSE Conference (oSC) 2014 has ended :'-(

A huge thanks to [Svebor Prstačić][1] and his fine crew from both Zagreb and Dubrovnik Universities. They did a wonderful job, and if there were any pain points they made sure that only they felt them.
