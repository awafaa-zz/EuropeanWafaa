I have packaged up the latest and greatest release (0.1.1.1) of [the-board][1]from [Lucas Rocha][2].  If’ you want a bit more background have a look at my previous [post][3].

I also said that it was for 11.4/Factory only and that 11.3 was a WIP.  Well the progress is complete (with huge help from [Frederic Crozat][4], and his great [GNOME3][5] repo).

Yes, more people can have some of this cool shiny stuff. There is a but, and this is from upstream – it is still in development so you may loose a kitten or bunny, maybe even both ;-)  So come and join the fun and try it out, I’ve not generated a single .ymp file yet so click on your version of Geeko
