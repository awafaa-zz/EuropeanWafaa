The big update is that a couple of kind companies have stepped up and sponsored some hardware for the effort to get openSUSE on ARM. Huge thank you to:

Ti in association with the PandaBoard community have kindly sponsored and are shipping several PandaBoards.

Thank you, this is a huge help.

Now that we have some devices on our way it doesn’t mean we can sit back and relax, we still need more devices. Yes, I’m going to say it again – Please help the Geeko and donate as much or as little as you can (preferably not zero ;-) ).

So what else is new? Well openSUSE has managed to run on a couple of modern ARM devices. Joop Boonen [managed][6] to get openSUSE running on his PandaBoard. He even made a couple of videos:

Michal Hrušecký [managed][11] to get openSUSE running on his ASUS Transformer Tablet (albeit in a chroot), he has also provided [information][12] on how to do this yourself if you’re feeling brave :-)

We still don’t have anything that we can release yet, as we are still working to fix packages. We are fighting forward and we will succeed!!
