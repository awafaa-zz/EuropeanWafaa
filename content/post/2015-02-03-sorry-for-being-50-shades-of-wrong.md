I was at the wonderful [FOSDEM][1] this weekend just gone and met up with many fine folk (as always) unfortunately there were also many people I didn't manage to catch up with. On the Sunday I attended a talk on The [Tumbleweed Factory][2] given by openSUSE's very own Release Manager, Coolo. I made a statement about this talk, and have been challenged on that statement - I'm glad that I was challenged by one of our community members, because they were quite right to do so.

In Coolo's talk he mentioned that SUSE is thinking about pushing the sources for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to the Open Build Service for people to use. Unfortunately I managed to butcher this very simple statement and completely twist the message by tweeting the following:

This statement is not only factually incorrect, but is wrong. So wrong in fact that it is not only wrong, but **WRONG!** 

* Coolo did **NOT** say that *ALL* SUSE sources will be published; SUSE has a wide and growing portfolio, all of which is based on open source technologies. Coolo was quite clear on it being SLES, unfortunately *I* tuned out the LES and only heard SUSE - sorry!

* Coolo did not mention updates, *I* presumed that they would be added to OBS.

For this I am genuinely sorry. It was not my intention to misrepresent/inflate or just plain lie about what was said. As a member of the openSUSE Board, I should know better than to twist and massage a simple statement. I can't say anything other than sorry, I completely accept that I was wrong. Hopefully Coolo's slides will be available soon as will the video recording of his talk.

Coolo, Ich bin ein esel!
