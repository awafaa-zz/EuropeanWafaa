Next week I’ll be in Orlando attending both [SUSE Con][2], and also [openSUSE Summit][3]. Not only will I be attending the Summit, but I’ll also be joining Michael Miller in the [Opening Ceremony][4]. In addition to you being able to see, talk and interact with me, I’ll also be [giving away a whole heap of goodies][5] ;-) So if you’re in the area and have an interest in ARM or most things Geeko, please give me a shout. I’d also be interested in talking to companies that are thinking about ARM but need some more discussion on the topic.
