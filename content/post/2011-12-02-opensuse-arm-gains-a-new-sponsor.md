I am very pleased to announce that ARM Holdings has joined our current sponsors, by providing a pile of Texas instruments OMAP4430 powered [Pandaboards][2] and some Samsung Exynos4210 powered [Origen boards][3]! Many thanks to the fine folks in Cambridge for their most generous donation.

In addition to that, thanks to the community’s donations, we have also obtained an ST-Ericsson Nova A9500 powered [Snowball board][4]. Huge thanks to everyone that has made this happen. I know we originally were aiming for Pandaboards, but we need to make sure we aren’t leaving anyone out. Saying that we still need some more, so don’t stop helping out (please).

We are cracking on with getting things working, and even have openSUSE running natively on a few devices, although there are some very rough edges at the moment.
