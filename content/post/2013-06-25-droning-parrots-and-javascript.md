I was fortunate enough to get a present for surviving another year of life, a shiny new [AR.Drone2.0][1]. This was something that I had desired sometime ago but then dismissed as an expensive toy with little expansion. That desire returned recently after being enlightened to the hacking opportunities, not just hacking the device directly but more around the hacking of applications to use with it. Yet again it was [Laurent Eschenauer][2] to blame with his excellent [ardrone-webflight][3].

This is the first time I've really looked at [node.js][6], and it is actually a pretty powerful framework. Laurent and co have done a fabulous job at hooking into the APIs that are exposed by the AR.Drone2.0.
