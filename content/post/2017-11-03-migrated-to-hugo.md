So my blog has been dormant for some time, and in that time I've had a variety of hardware failures etc. As such my previous [nanoc](https://nanoc.ws/) based site was lost. Thankfully all the content was stored in git so was easy to recover. I thought if I'm going to restart blogging I might as well look at a different platform, and it looks like all the cool kids are using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) so here we are.
