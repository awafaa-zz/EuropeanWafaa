Looks like it’s been a while since I mentioned anything about our dear friend Smeegol – sorry.

As most will know MeeGo made a couple of releases:

*   1.0.5 mostly an update to their original release
*   1.1.0 the new release with new API, and renaming most packages

So where is Smeegol?  Well we’re pretty much there, although not 100%.  I have 1.0.5 all built and packaged including an image.  Problem is I seem to have hit a bug with network-manager-netbook – it doesn’t seem to be displaying networks which is a fairly fundamental issue :-(

I have also got 1.1.0 built, but for factory only atm – I’m having some issues with tracker on 11.3.  Problem is when I try and run the image, I basically have an unusable system thanks to some Gconf fubar but I don’t really know what.

You may have also noticed that I’m still calling it Smeegol ;-) Well the simple reason is I have requested clarification from MeeGo, Nokia, Intel and the Linux Foundation and so far I’ve received bubkiss!!  I heard loads of talk from the recent MeeGo Conference about how open MeeGo was, but it seems that they are only open to partners who can help them make money; not open to the wider community.  I am not alone in waiting for a response from them, Fedora and Debian are also in limbo waiting for information/clarification and general communication from them.  The difference between us is the fact that in openSUSE if you want something done the best way is to Just Do It :-)

So in a nutshell, before I make an official release of either I need people to test and report back to me what does and doesn’t work.  I haven’t tried doing an upgrade from 1.0.3 to 1.0.5 or 1.1.0 so maybe someone could try that.  Jump onto #opensuse-moblin on Freenode or the opensuse-goblin mailing list and let’s continue to be trail blazers. Yes I know I need to align the mailing list and irc channel names, but I’m waiting for a conclusion to the name debacle first.

I would really love to get both releases out as a little christmas present to you the community, so who’s up for some festive fun?
