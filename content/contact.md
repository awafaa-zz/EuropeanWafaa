To get hold of me you can find me on IRC, I use the nick awafaa or FunkyPenguin on the following networks:

* Freenode
* OFTC
* EFNet
* GNOME

You can get hold of me on the social networks linked in the sidebar.

Even better would be to find me in person at an event, we can chat over a beverage then ;-)
