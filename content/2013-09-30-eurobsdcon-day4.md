![EuroBSDCon 2013 Malta][A]

The final day of EuroBSDCon kicked off and I gave my talk on "[Introducing the 64-bit ARMv8 Architecture][1]" in the morning, actually the morning in Track 3 was overtaken by ARM related talks :-). My talk went down well (no rotten fruit/veg was thrown! \o/), and it was nearly a full room people from various flavours of BSD which was encouraging. There were some good questions and some suggestions for things that could make things easier for the developers to support ARM moving forward which is always useful to hear. After my talk Zbigniew Bodek from SemiHalf gave a talk on Getting NetBSD onto the Marvell Armada XP SoC, followed by Andrew Turner explaining the process of how FreeBSD goes about supporting new SoCs.

Can anyone tell me what company is responsible for > 32% of all downstream traffic in the USA, with 25% handled by FreeBSD? The answer is..... Netflix! After Lunch there was an excellent talk by Alistair Crooks from Netflix, where he introduced the [Open Connect Appliance][2]. If you get the chance to see Alistair talk make sure you do, as his [dingbats][3] are excellent (although some are exceptionally groan worthy!)
